BENIN – No fewer than four persons, including a baby, were confirmed dead on Monday, as a vehicle plunged into a river at Ofosu, a boundary town between Edo and Ondo states on the Lagos-Benin Expressway. However, a female was said to have survived with injuries. The incident, as gathered, involved a Toyota Sienna car with five occupants, probably a family. An eyewitness, Jefferson Uwoghiren, a Benin based lawyer and former reporter with The Guardian, said he met the scene while returning to Benin City from Lagos. He said there were conflicting statements on the actual brand of vehicle that plunged into the river. He said while some persons he spoke to said it was a private car with husband, wife and children, others say it was a commercial bus. Mr. Uwoghiren, however, confirmed that he saw a baby and three other bodies being pulled out by a team of sympathisers who gathered in the rescue operation before the arrival of men of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC). When contacted, the Unit Commander, FRSC, RS5. 12, Okada Unit, Mr. A. C. Abdullahi confirmed receiving a similar report. Abdullahi said four persons including a baby died after their vehicle plunged into the river. The accident, he said, occurred at the Ofosu Bridge and it involved a green Toyota Sienna. Similarly, Edo Sector Commander of the FRSC, Mr. Anthony Oko, confirmed the incident, which he attributed to over-speeding. Oko said the victims had been taken to Ago Itunu Hospital and Mortuary at Ofosu in Ondo State. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
