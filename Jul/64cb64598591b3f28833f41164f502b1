Tokyo-Jul 18 (Prensa Latina) Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Koreeda made official the presence of actors Juliette Binoche and Ethan Hawke in his upcoming film La Vérité (The Truth), despite regretting the details previously leaked, the local press reported. After being awarded the Palme d’Or at Cannes for the police drama A Family Affair, Koreeda confessed when presenting it in the capital that his frustration about The Truth was ‘disconcerting, because there were rumors about the names of the actors and how much they were paid’. The film will be made entirely in France, Binoche’s native country, in October and November of this year, and will be produced jointly by French company 3B Productions and Kore-eda’s Bunbuku. Binoche and Hawke will star as a married couple returning to France from the United States when the wife’s mother, (Catherine Deneuve), in the film a well-known actress, publishes her autobiography. During this meeting several secrets are revealed which will put the peace of mind of all family members in tatters. The script for The Truth is based on a play written by Koreeda almost 15 years ago, but never produced. The film is expected to hit cinemas in 2019, although the date is not yet set. Koreeda (1962, Tokyo) has been working as a film director since 1991 and his works explore themes such as memory, death and how to deal with the loss of loved ones. He wanted to be a novelist, however, after graduating from Waseda University – one of Japan’s best and most prestigious private high schools – he worked as an assistant director of documentaries for TV Man Union. He has also produced films for directors Miwa Nishikawa and Yusuke Iseya. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
