Lagos – Leicester City of England midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi could become the next Nigerian player to play for Arsenal of England, as The Gunners are said to be in the hunt for his signature. Following two sterling seasons with The Foxes, Ndidi has caught attention from far and wide, with latest hints now emerging that he could be on the way to joining fellow-Super Eagles star, Alex Iwobi at Emirates Stadium this summer. DAILY INDEPENDENT learnt that the Arsenal link comes at a point Ndidi has not been included in the equation at Leicester, who are reportedly ready to hand Jamie Vardy and Harry Maguire new contracts. “Without any mention of reward for Ndidi’s superlative form, The Foxes will offer new big money deals to World Cup stars, Maguire and Vardy when they return from Russia. “The England pair are due back this week and Foxes bosses are keen to keep hold of both players,” we gathered. Leicester want to put Maguire on around £80,000-a-week and Vardy on £120,000 a week as boss Claude Puel aims to strengthen his squad after Riyad Mahrez’s £60million move to Manchester City. However, a top official at King Poweer Stadium insists Ndidi has not been left out of the picture, with a declaration that Leicester are set to try and secure the youngster’s long-term future by rewarding him with a pay rise. Leicester will be buoyed by Ndidi’s comments that he is happy with the club and denied that he was contemplating a move elsewhere. “A transfer has never been on my mind, I feel very good at Leicester,” said Ndidi, whose 15 tackles during the Super Eagles’ three matches at Russia 2018 World Cup are still the joint-second overall at the tournament. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
