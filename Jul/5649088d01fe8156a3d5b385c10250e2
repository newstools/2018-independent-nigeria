Emmanuel Amuneke, the former Super Eagles and FC Barcelona of Spain winger, has been chosen by the world football governing body (FIFA) as a member of the panel that will shortlist candidates for men’s footballers and coaches of the year for the 2017/2018 season. Amuneke, who was part of the Super Eagles side that won the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations in Tunisia, was also one of Nigeria’s top performers in the World Cup that same year in the United States of America. The winger scored twice in the competition with the Super Eagles making their mark despite a second round exit against Italy. The former Zamalek of Egypt and Sporting Lisbon of Portugal star is joined in the panel by former England coach, Fabio Capello, and former football stars like Ronaldo Nazario de Lima, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba, Lothar Matthaus and Alessandro Nesta. Others are Sami Jabar, CHA Bum-Kun, Andy Roxburgh, Kaka, Wynston Rufer and Carlos Alberto Parreira. The Best FIFA Football Awards is the premier annual awards celebration held by football’s world governing body.

The voting process for the men’s and women’s awards will open on July 23 and close on August 10. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
