GUSAU – Zamfara State wing of Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has said it would continue to lament that its members were working on a very tight rope, saying that practicing in a security challenged environment was the worst thing that would happen to any qualified doctor anywhere in the world. Speaking during the Scientific Conference week with the theme, ‘Safe medical practice in a security challenged environment’ in Gusau, Zamfara State Capital, Dr. Olagunde Kehinde Williams lamented that in many occasions, doctors were being brutalised even by the security operatives. The state NMA boss wondered why some individuals would see medical doctors as one of the affluent segments of the society, pointing out that medical practitioners are always identified as Good Samaritans working on humanitarian services except in Zamfara State where the case has proved otherwise. Dr. Williams explained that it was only when the doctors work in a secure environment that they can exhibit their professionalism and excellent services and sustainable professional expertise that would give the citizens qualitative healthcare services adding that his members cannot exhibit their professionalism and excellence due to insecurity situation that have been affecting their civic responsibility. In his response, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Kenneth Ebrimson explained that the security operatives in the state were on top of the security issue and had designed effective measures to end insecurity in the state. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
