The Katsina State Government has said that it was working with the World Bank to spend N50 billion to tackle erosion, desertification and flooding in the state. Governor Aminu Masari, who made the disclosure during an interview with the newsmen said the money would be provided through the Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP). The World Bank would soon be launching the project in the state. The governor said that the government was doing a lot in addressing environmental challenges since its inauguration in 2015. He said the administration has spent over N5 billion on the construction of drainage across the state over the last three years. ‘‘When you have a good drainage system, you have reduced the issue of collapsed buildings as a result of over flooding especially in the low-level areas in the state. ‘‘That will also assist in reducing the loss of farmlands due to erosion,’’ he said. Masari said the government had been sensitising the people against building houses with substandard materials to reduce damage by a windstorm. ‘‘People should seek the advice of experts with regards to the directional flow of wind before building houses,’’ he added. He said that the government would continue to provide information on weather condition for the people to take appropriate measures to reduce the magnitude of windstorm disasters being recorded in the state. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
