ABEOKUTA – Otunba Olusegun Bolanle Gbeleyi, a Senatorial aspirant in the forthcoming general election, has called for the review of the nation’s revenue-sharing formula as well as electoral constituencies by the Federal Government. Gbeleyi, who made the call in Abeokuta, said that the Ogun State capital during a media parley said the call became imperative, adding that it would give room for proper development and even distribution of the nation’s resources. The aspirant who is aspiring for the Ogun West Senatorial District ticket under the ruling All Progress Congress (APC) in next year’s election, explained that with fast-growing population of the country, it was high time revenue sharing formula and delineation of electoral constituencies as matters of urgency. The aspirant, who is a consultant to Governor Ibikunle Amosun on Power, said there was the need for revolution and review in the sharing formula so as to distribute the wealth of the country across the length and breadth of the nation. He disclosed that the revenue sharing formula and constituencies were done decades ago with the condition that it may be reviewed if the need arises. Gbeleyi, a former Deputy Speaker of the State House of Assembly stated, “We need revolution for proper change if we want to progress. We need to review our revenue sharing formula and our constituencies for distribution of the country’s wealth. “We are rich enough to cater for our needs; it is just the sharing formula we need to review,” he said. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
