Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Ghasemi announced the summoning of French ambassador to Iran in protest against the French government’s decision to allow an anti-Iran terror group to hold its annual gathering in Paris. Foreign Ministry’s assistant director-general for European affairs has summoned French Ambassador to Tehran Bruno Foucher on Tuesday and strongly condemned French government’s decision to allow and support MKO anti-Iran terror group to hold its annual gathering in Paris, Ghasemi asserted. Foreign Ministry has told Bruno Foucher that France must prevent the gathering of some groups of a terrorist nature, albeit small and worthless, to protect under the name of freedom of expression in promoting extremism and terrorism. Ghasemi added Iran also blasted the presence of a number of former US radical officials in the gathering who made interventionist and divisive speeches against the Iranian nation. The French ambassador, for his part, promised to convey all afore-mentioned points to the government and relevant officials of his country and will announce their response immediately. Back on Saturday, the terror group held its annual meeting in Paris with a number of American hawks such as Rudy Giuliani – Donald Trump’s personal lawyer – and other former US officials as well as former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper in attendance. This is not the first time that the French government is allowing the MKO to hold its anti-Iran gathering in Paris. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
