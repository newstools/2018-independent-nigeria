Lagos – The downtrend in the local bourse was sustained last week as the All Share Index (ASI) trended southwards on four of five trading sessions. Consequently, the benchmark index slid 2.1 per cent Week-On-Week (W-o-W) to settle at 36,603.44 points, while year-to-date (YTD) loss declined to -4.3 per cent. As a result, investors lost N285.9 billion in value as market capitalisation decreased to N13.3 trillion. The negative performance was largely due to price depreciation in bellwethers – FBN Holdings (-13.0%), Guaranty Trust Bank (-4.4%) and Zenith Bank (-4.2%). However, activity level was mixed as average volume advanced 48.2 per cent to 332.9 million units while average value traded fell 12.0 per cent to N3.0 billion. The top traded stocks by volume were Transnational Corporation (102.4m), Guaranty Trust Bank (98.0m) and FBN Holdings (80.0m) while Guaranty Trust Bank (N3.7bn), Zenith Bank (N1.7bn) and Nigerian Breweries (N0.9bn) were the top traded stocks by value. The week kicked off on a negative note, maintaining a downward trend till the fourth trading session despite positive corporate releases in the week. United Capital, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated, Unilever Nigeria, Wema Bank and Medview  Airline were amongst the companies who released positive half year 2018 results, however, sentiment stayed soft for most of the week and improved slightly on Friday following gains in Dangote Cement (+2.0%). Furthermore, a closer look at the performance of sectors we cover was equally bearish as four of five indices closed in the red. The consumer goods index was the biggest loser, down 3.7 per cent following losses in Nestle Nigeria (-6.4%) and Nigerian Breweries (-2.3%) while the banking and industrial goods indices followed suit, shedding 3.6 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively following sell offs in Guaranty Trust Bank (-4.4%), Zenith Bank (-4.2%) and Lafarge Cement WAPCO (-9.3%). In the same vein, price depreciation in Forte Oil (-3.5%) dragged the oil & gas index 2.2 per cent lower. On the flip side, the Insurance index was the lone gainer, rising 0.1 per cent W-o-W on the back of price appreciation in Linkage Assurance (+9.7%) and Continental Re-insurance (+3.4%). comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
