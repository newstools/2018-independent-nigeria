Al-Taya said that Israel does this in order to the Arab population while encouraging Jewish expansionism. Head of the Follow Up Committee Mohamed Baraka said: “The crime which took place this morning [demolition of the two houses] is an extension of the crimes of the Israeli authorities in Umm Al-Fahm, Ar’ara and Jajoulia.” He added: “We must bring all our efforts together to face these challenges… We have no weapons and we cannot win the legal battles as the law was laid down to facilitate uprooting the Arab citizens.” Meanwhile, Head of the Municipality of Qalansawa Abdel-Baset Salama said: “We were in contact with specialists in the issue of planning and construction regarding the two houses, but the racist [Israeli] courts turned down all out proposals to iron out the issue.” He added: “The two houses were part of the city’s plan and we had documents for this. We started the procedures to get the licenses, but we were surprised with demolition orders.” comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
