Novak Djokovic completed his rehabilitation among tennis’s true elite when he blew away Kevin Anderson to claim his fourth Wimbledon title. In what was a straight sets men’s final for the third year running – featuring a multiple champion against a first time finalist – the 31 year-old Serb defeated an often tired looking opponent 6-2 6-2 7-6(3) in two hours and 19 minutes. It means that becoming the Wimbledon winner remains the most closed shop in tennis. Going back to Lleyton Hewitt in 2002 only four players have held the men’s singles trophy – Roger Federer, Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray. “It feels amazing because for the first time in my life I have someone screaming Daddy,’ said Djokovic, referring to his son Stefan up in the player box. ‘I can’t be happier. Today being Kevin’s first Wimbledon he didn’t play his best in the first two sets but in the third he was the better player. “I had to really trust the process and trust in myself, the last couple of years haven’t been that easy. I had a surgery and was absent from the tour. I had many moments of doubt and didn’t know if I could come back to the level to compete and there’s no better place to make a comeback. This is a sacred place for tennis. The grass tasted good, I had a double portion.’ Anderson rises to World No 5 as a result of his terrific two weeks at SW19. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
