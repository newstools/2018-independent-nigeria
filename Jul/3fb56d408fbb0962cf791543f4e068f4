Nominations for the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards were announced Thursday morning. One bright spot of this year’s nominees is Sandra Oh, who made history with her Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series nomination for Killing Eve, according to Cosmopolitan.com reports. Sandra is the first Asian actress to be nominated in the category. But it’s not her first time in the nominees circle: she’s been up for the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series Emmy five times for her work as my dream BFF/fellow floor crier Cristina Yang on Grey’s Anatomy. Her win for Killing Eve would definitely make up for all the times she lost. If Sandra takes home an Emmy in September, she’ll join a small but growing club. Only two Asian actors have won Emmys in its 70-year history: Archie Panjabi for The Good Wife in 2010 (Outstanding Supporting Actress) and Riz Ahmed for The Night Of in 2017 (Outstanding Lead Actor). Sandra is up against Claire Foy (The Crown), fellow Canadian Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black), Keri Russell (The Americans), Evan Rachel Wood (Westworld), and last year’s winner Elisabeth Moss (The Handmaid’s Tale). The 70th Primetime Emmy Awards will be handed out Sept. 17. She really should have won all the Emmys.  comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
