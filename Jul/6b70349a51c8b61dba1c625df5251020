French football superstar Kylian Mbappe is reportedly going to donate US$500,000 in World Cup earnings to charity. According to Sports Illustrated, the 19-year-old forward earned about US$22,500 (NZ$33,000) for each of France’s seven World Cup matches, plus a bonus of around US$350,000 (NZ$515,000) after Les Bleus won the title with a 4-2 victory over Croatia. But he apparently won’t be keeping any of it. Instead, according to French news outlet L’Equipe, he will be donating it all to Premiers de Cordee, a charity that provides sports activities to hospitalised and disabled children. Mbappe first formed an association with the charity in 2017, according to Le Parisien. Sebastian Ruffin, Premiers de Cordee’s general manager, called Mbappe “a great person” in a brief interview with the French publication. “We were made aware by the entourage of the player and his family a few days ago,” Ruffin said. “We do not want to come forward, because the bonus would be paid only in case of qualification of the Blues in the quarterfinals, but we are very touched by the approach of Kylian. “This is a very personal approach made by the player: We never ask for financial help from our sponsors.” Mbappe, who scored four goals during the World Cup and took home Fifa’s Best Young Player award, made about US$1.8 million (NZ$2.7m) per month while playing last season for French club Paris Saint-Germain, and he’s set to make a whole lot more in the future. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
