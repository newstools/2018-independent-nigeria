Britain demanded answers from Russia on Thursday after a couple was exposed to the same nerve agent used on a former Russian spy and his daughter in an attempted murder blamed on Moscow. But Russia quickly hit back, denouncing Britain for playing “dirty political games” and demanding London apologise. The British couple fell ill on Saturday in Amesbury, a small town near the southwestern English city of Salisbury where former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed on March 4. That incident triggered a major diplomatic crisis with Russia after Britain and its allies accused Moscow of trying to kill the Skripals – a charge strongly denied by the Kremlin. Novichok is a military-grade nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Speaking to parliament on Thursday, Interior Minister, Sajid Javid, said a link between the cases was “clearly the main line of inquiry”. “It is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on,” he said. “It is completely unacceptable for our people to be either deliberate or accidental targets, or for our streets, our parks, our towns to be dumping grounds for poison.” The remarks sparked a sharp response from Moscow. “We urge British law enforcement not to get involved in dirty political games,” foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, told reporters. “This government and its representatives will have to apologise to Russia and the international community,” she said. Police said tests on the couple, named locally as Dawn Sturgess, 44, and Charlie Rowley, 45, revealed they were exposed to Novichok, later confirming they had handled “a contaminated item”. It was not immediately clear what the item was, nor if the substance was from the same batch used on the Skripals. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
