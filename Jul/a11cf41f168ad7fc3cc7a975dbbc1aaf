Most members of the Nigeria Football Supporters Football Club (NFSC) were unable to access the stadiums in Russia because of lack of match tickets. A member of the club, Ladejo Kazeem, who spoke on behalf of others on Tuesday hinted that they were neglected by the leadership of the club, despite getting sponsorship worth N100,000 million. Ladejo, who at the airport in Moscow on his return to Nigeria said that their members could not afford the exorbitant black market rate, hence they were unable to lend their support for the Super Eagles. He also said that several of their members, especially the trumpeters and side attraction members were left at home while old members of the club, who have no role to play were ferried to Russia by the leadership of the club. “Many of our members did not have match tickets. We could not afford to buy at the black market. I bought a ticket for $300 for me to be able to watch the match against Iceland. Rafiu Ladipo gave me a ticket to watch the game against Croatia while the president of the club gave me the ticket for the game against Argentina. “Most of the members stayed outside because they don’t have tickets and cannot buy at the black market. There was no accommodation, no any allowance paid to members. “I paid N200, 000 for my return ticket to the club. It is sad, this is my sixth World Cup I will be attending as a member of the club,” he said. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
