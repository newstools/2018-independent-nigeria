The National Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, Uche Secondus, on Thursday led a protest to the National Assembly over the alleged attack on the Ekiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose by men of the Nigeria Police ahead of Saturday, gubernatorial poll in the state. It would be recalled that security operatives had reportedly on Wednesday blocked the entrance to the State’s Government House in Ado Ekiti, the state capital. The security agents were alleged to have shot teargas canisters to disperse the crowd, with pictures circulated on social media, of Governor Fayose being affected by the teargas canisters. Videos later appeared on social media, showing Governor Fayose with a neck collar and a bandaged hand, lamenting attacks on his person by men of the Nigeria police force, and warning that should he be killed days leading up to the guber poll in the state, Nigerians should demand answers from President Muhammadu Buhari and the Inspector General of Police, IGP, Ibrahim Idris. The Police have since denied any wrong doing and have absolved its men of any involvement in the Governor’s alleged attack. But, speaking during the protest, the PDP Chairman said he led the delegation to submit a petition to the lawmakers on the alleged action of the police. Secondus was accompanied by members and leaders of the PDP.  comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
