 A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress ( APC) in Ekiti State, Alhaji Kamal Ladejobi, on Monday said the state has suffered untold retrogression under Governor Ayo Fayose in the last four years owing to the failure of the governor to update himself with happenings in the country through the dailies. Speaking in a chat with Daily Independent, Ladejobi said the governor only relies on social media and online platforms to get his news and thereafter issue statements and make comments without verifying the authenticity of the news. He said this is very evident in comments made by the governor wnich is always off the mark and has made Ekiti a laughing stock among other states. ” I know the governor very well. Those working with him said he has not read a single newspaper since he became governor”. ” They said Lere Olayinka, his Special Adviser on New Media told him the world no longer read newspapers and so the governor only make comments based on anything he sees online and social media pages”. While expressing confidence that APC will triumph in Saturday’s governorship election, the APC chieftain said the people of the state who are tired of Fayose will never allow his stooge, Prof. Kolapo Olusola-Eleka to continue in office. ” I don’t see how PDP can win. Ekiti people are intellectuals. They are not stupid. Having grounded the state in the last four years, you now want to impose your Deputy who is not a politician, who is not even interested in becoming governor on them so you can continue ruling from the backdoor. How is that going to work here?” he asked.  0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
