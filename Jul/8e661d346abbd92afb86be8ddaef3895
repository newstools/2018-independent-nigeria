Long before the Lekki-Ajah axis of Lagos became a hot destination; Alesh Hotels had been attracting fun seekers to the place. It was a beehive of entertainment activities and every weekend was a blast. Almost all the top Nigerian musicians have performed at the place and many also cut their teeth there as young artistes. It is however sad to learn that the place might cease to exist due to unpaid loans by the owner. A court, during the week, ordered interim forfeiture of the hotel, which belongs to Rilwan Aleshinloye to the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). With the judgement, Alesh Hotels located at 1 Alesh Hotel Road, Ajah temporarily ceases to be the property of Rilwan Aleshinloye, pending a final judgement on the matter. AMCON had dragged him to court over an unpaid debt of N187 million being the alleged balance of a loan issued in favour of Rilwan and Alesh Hotels by the defunct Bank PhB in 2008. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
