Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic has undergone an MRI scan to determine the severity of the shoulder injury he sustained in the round-of-16 victory over Denmark at the World Cup. Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic says the team is still waiting on the results of the scans to determine whether Kovacic will be available to play on Saturday when Croatia faces Russia in the quarterfinals. Kovacic was hurt late in the second half when he was tripped up and fell onto his right side with his right arm extended. His shoulder took the brunt of the fall, but he remained in the match. Kovacic entered in the 71st minute replacing Marcelo Brozovic. Dalic said: “His shoulder hurts very much and all the credit to him because he played with a really tough injury. He showed great courage.” Kovacic has appeared in every match at the World Cup and started in the victory over Iceland. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
