Unilever Nigeria Plc led in terms of percentage growth in profitability. The company  recorded  78 per cent increase in profitability which rose to N3.92 billion in Q1’18 from N2.18 billion Q1’17, followed by Champion Breweries Plc with 71.2 percent growth to N96.51 million from N56.38 million. NASCON Allied Industries Plc recorded 33.2 per cent growth to N1.56 billion from N1.72 billion, while Dangote Sugar Refinery posted 19.2 per cent PBT growth to N8.39    billion from N7.04 billion in Q1’17. Figures obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics have revealed that the manufacturing sector recorded a decline of about N30 billion in output in the first quarter of the year  just as the Central Bank on Nigeria (CBN) said in its Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) report has been growing faster than expected. An analysis of the GDP report prepared by the NBS showed that the sector recorded a total output of N2.66trn at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. However, the level of productivity in the sector dropped by N30 billion from the fourth quarter 2017 figure to N2.63trn in the first three months of this year. The sector had been badly hit by the harsh operating environment, which took its toll on the profit margins of many companies operating in that segment of the economy. There are 13 sub-sectors that make up the manufacturing sector. Out of the 13 sub-sectors,  five recorded increase in economic performance between December 2017 and March this year, while eight recorded decrease in productivity. The five sub-sectors that recorded increase in economic performance are cement from N228.8bn in December to N251.8 billion in March 2018; wood and woods products, from N78.85 billion to N82.14 billion; pulps and paper products, from N23.67 billion to N23.77 billion; non-metallic products, from N104.17 billion to N110.21 billion; and motor vehicle assembly, from N16.48 billion to N19.64 billion. The sub-sectors that recorded decline in productivity include oil refining, from N42.69bn to N41.55 billion; food, beverage and tobacco, from N1.21 trillion to N1.19 trillion; textile, apparel and footwear, from N642.55 billion to N610.64 billion; and chemical and pharmaceutical products, from N58.91 billion to N55.23 billion. The rest are plastic and rubber products, from N84.59 billion to N83.99 billion; electrical and electronics, from N1.9 billion to N1.4 billion; iron and steel, from N66.68 billion to N58.82 billion; and other manufacturing, from N109.53 billion to N105.93 billion. Significantly, while companies are experiencing mixed bag in their performances, the Central Bank on Nigeria (CBN), in its Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) report for March 2018, reported that PMI grew faster in March. It shows a reading of 56.7 index points, indicating an expansion in the manufacturing sector for the twelfth consecutive month. The February manufacturing PMI stood at 56.3 index points. The CBN’s manufacturing and non-Manufacturing PMI report on businesses is based on survey responses indicating the changes in the level of business activities in the review month compared with the preceding month. According to the March Manufacturing PMI report: “Of the 14 sub-sectors surveyed, 11 reported growth in the review month in the following order: electrical equipment; cement; petroleum & coal products; food, beverage & tobacco products; chemical & pharmaceutical products; fabricated metal products; paper products; transportation equipment; plastics & rubber products; textile, apparel, leather and footwear and primary metal. The remaining three subsectors contracted in the following order: nonmetallic mineral products; furniture & related products and printing & related support activities.” Similarly, the report showed that at 59.1 points, the production level index for the manufacturing sector grew for the thirteenth consecutive month in March 2018 with seven of the 14 manufacturing sub-sectors recording increase in production level, three remained unchanged, while the remaining four recorded declines. Also, the employment level index in March 2018 stood at 53.3 points, indicating growth in employment level for the tenth consecutive month. Expansion was also recorded in the CBN’s PMI for the non-manufacturing sector as the index stood at 57.2 points in March 2018, indicating expansion in the non-manufacturing PMI for the eleventh consecutive month. “Fourteen of the 16 sub-sectors recorded growth in the following order: public administration; utilities; finance & insurance; management of companies; agriculture; electricity, gas, steam & air conditioning supply; professional, scientific, & technical services; water supply, sewage & waste management; educational services; wholesale/retail trade; information & communication; real estate rental & leasing; health care & social assistance; accommodation & food services,” the CBN stated. Similarly in April, the PMI stood at 56.9 index points, indicating expansion in the manufacturing sector for the 13th consecutive month, showing that the index grew at a faster rate when compared to the previous month. Of the 15 subsectors surveyed, 12 reported growth in the review month in the following order: Petroleum and coal products; electrical equipment; appliances and components; printing and related support activities; textile apparel leather and footwear; and fabricated metal products. Others are chemical and pharmaceutical products; food, beverage and tobacco products; paper products, furniture and related products; plastics and rubber products; and transportation equipment. The report indicated that the cement sub-sector remained unchanged, while the non-metallic minerals and primary metal subsectors declined in the review month. The CBN’s manufacturing PMI report further read in part, “At 58.6 points, the production level index for the manufacturing sector grew for the 14th consecutive month in April 2018. The index indicated a slower growth in the current month, when compared to its level in the preceding month. “Twelve of the 15 manufacturing subsectors recorded increase in production levels; one remained unchanged, while the remaining two recorded declines in production levels during the review. At 55.8 points, new orders index grew for the thirteenth consecutive month, indicating increase in new orders in April 2018.  Seven subsectors reported growth; four remained unchanged while four contracted in the review month.” The manufacturing supplier delivery time index stood at 57.4 points in April 2018, indicating faster supplier delivery time for the 11th consecutive month. Backward Integration showing reward Most manufacturers who are unable to import have found alternative sources of raw materials locally. Guinness Nigeria Plc announced that it had increased its local sourcing of raw materials from 43 to 75 per cent. Peter Ndegwa, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, attributed the 131 per cent increase in operating profit of the firm in 2017 to this decision. The President, MAN, Dr. Frank Jacobs, said capacity utilisation by all manufacturing subsectors increased from 44.3 per cent in the first half of 2016 to 59.18 per cent in the second half of 2016 and in the first half of 2017. “In addition, some of the companies that closed shops resumed operations; employees laid off were called back; local raw materials utilisation rate increased significantly; and the perception of business promoters on the economy improved,” he said. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
