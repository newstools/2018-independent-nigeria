P/HARCOURT – The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Nigeria has warned Nigerian investors to be wary of fraudsters who pose as financial managers. The SEC, which gave the warning at a town hall meeting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State on Wednesday tagged, “Current Initiatives by the Securities and Exchange Commission Nigeria to enhance Investors Value,” also cautioned Nigerians against investing in Ponzi schemes. Speaking, Mary Uduak, the Acting Director-General of SEC, urged Nigerians to make their money investment appropriately and shun intentions of money doubling. Uduak said, “The purpose is also to ensure that you do not fall victim to the antics of fraudsters who purport to be able to double any amount of money you make available to them as investment value. “These fraudsters or promoters of Ponzi Schemes are the false prophets of the investment environment, they are the ill-wind that blows no good and at whose sight you must flee; they are to be avoided. “This is one message you must take home to your family, friends, relations and acquaintances in order to save them from the agony of loss of their hard-earned money.” The Acting DG disclosed that SEC has commenced a process to move all shareholders to an e-Dividend regime, which she said would help to reduce issues of unclaimed dividends. “SEC is currently leading the entire capital market industry in an effort to migrate all shareholders to an e- dividend regime. The essence of the e-Dividend Mandate Management System is to eradicate or reduce to the barest minimum the incidence of unclaimed dividend. “Unclaimed dividend is an undesirable feature of the Nigerian capital market which denies investors/shareholders the gains of participating in the capital market,” she added. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
