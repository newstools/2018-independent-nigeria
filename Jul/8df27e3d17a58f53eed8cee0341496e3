A 31-year-old man, Eteng Arikpo, on Friday appeared before a Karu Magistratesâ€™ Court sitting in Abuja for allegedly stealing 25-litre 10 gallons of groundnut oil worth N130,000. Arikpo, who resides at Karu, is facing a three-count charge of criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal misappropriation. He, however, denied the charge and was admitted to a bail of N200, 000 with one surety. Police Prosecutor Vincent Osuji had told the court the complainant, Odoh Sunday, of Karu Market, Abuja, reported the case at Karu Police Station on June 11 at 10. 00 p.m. Sunday had given the gallons of groundnut oil to the accused and he agreed to pay back in three days after he must have sold the commodity which he collected on credit, he said. He added that he accused, after selling the items, converted the money to personal use and absconded until he was arrested. The offences contravened Sections 312, 322 and 309 of the Penal Code. The Judge, Linda Ibegu, adjourned the case until July 31 for hearing. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
