Donald Trump said on Saturday that he spoke to the  Saudi king  about the need to increase Saudi Arabia’s oil production to two million barrels due to an unstable situation in Iran and Venezuela, stressing that King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud agreed with the proposal. The US President posted the information about the talks on his Twitter account. Oil prices spiked this week after Washington said it would offer no extensions or waivers to Iran’s oil buyers when sanctions return in November. Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zaganeh stated earlier that the US could not have imposed sanctions on the country’s oil sector if Iranian crude exports had increased up to 4 million barrels a day.  comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
