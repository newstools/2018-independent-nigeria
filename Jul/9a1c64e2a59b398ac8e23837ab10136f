This week witnessed the official split of the ruling party, APC. For members of the party, the race for 2019 has just hit a bump on the road and it will take a lot of mending to get back on it. For Nigerians however, it really is nothing. It seems politicians do not know that Nigerians have stopped caring about what they do or don’t do. The aggrieved APC members call themselves Reformed APC or rAPC for short. They say they have suspended talks with the president’s faction and are ready to chart a new course. It is anybody’s guess, but I bet my last Kobo they will be returning to PDP. Most of those in the group used to be members of PDP. I was discussing the development with a friend recently, and all he had to say was, “who cares.” comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
