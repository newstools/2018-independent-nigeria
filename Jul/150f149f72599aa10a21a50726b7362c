ASABA – Mr. Omamofe Pirah, the Delta State Commissioner for Oil and Gas, has lamented that modular refineries in the state have not be able to function properly as a result of unapproved permits. He added that until the state government was made part of the regulatory process, policies that would help the sector grow would not be implemented. He said this on Thursday during a ministerial press briefing he disclosed that the modular refinery in the  Kwale axis was nearly completed. “We cannot specifically tell you a time frame when the modular refinery will be completed but from the design stage to completion is about 18 months. A lot of approval needs to be obtained, AT and P is partially operating. The lands that occupied by AT and P is enough to hold a modular refinery,” he stated. He regretted that regulating oil and gas is domiciled with the Federal Government, adding that until, “states were part of it, we will not be able to totally correct what is going on.” While lamenting that the constraint of the state in oil related issues have made it difficult for the state government to make its own decision concerning such issues, he said that the Petroleum Industrial Bill that has been broken down into different bills, including the Governance Bill, should be accented to by the President. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
