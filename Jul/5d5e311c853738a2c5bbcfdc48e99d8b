Lagos – Super Eagles goalkeeper at the just concluded World Cup in Russia, Francis Uzoho, has been named among the best players aged U-23 at the tournamet. Though he could not save Nigeria from crashing out at the group stage, the Deportivo La Coruna of Spain 19-year-old keeper has been rated among the best 11 youth players of the Mundial. While many Nigerians are also critical of his impact with the Super Eagles, a cross-section of independent pundits reckon the keeper showed promising performances against Croatia, Iceland and Argentina to deserve a place in the U-23 best starting 11 at Russia 2018. This is according to British newspaper, The Guardian, whose experts have outlined a team of 11 players and substitutes they consider as the best kids of Russia 2018. The Guardian wrote about Uzoho: “As one of only two goalkeepers under the age of 23 to have featured, the other being Tunisia’s Mouez Hassen, the teenager makes the cut almost by default but will still be relatively satisfied with his first major tournament despite Nigeria’s group-stage exit. “Uzoho was largely helpless to prevent any of the four goals he conceded in the defeats by Croatia and Argentina and will surely improve with age. “The next step for him is to gain first-team experience at Deportivo La Coruña, having spent the majority of last season in the reserves.” Meanwhile, Uzoho’s teammate, Oghenekaro Etebo of Stoke City of England is in the substitutes list. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
