Warri – The member representing Udu in the Delta State House of Assembly, Chief Peter Okagbare Uviejitobor has described Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State as God’s gift to Delta State deserving of the support of all Deltans because of his uncommon achievements in the past three years. The lawmaker stated this when the national officers of Senator Okowa Must Rule Again (SOMRA) movement paid him a solidarity visit at his Enerhen, Warri residence on Friday with the group pledging total support for the re-election of the governor and PDP flag-bearers in the coming polls. Addressing the visitors, Uviejitobor stated that the massive development stimulated by Governor Okowa’s SMART agenda for the state has brought succor to the people, stressing that Udu Local Government Area had never had it so good in terms of infrastructural and human capital developments which, he added, has boosted the morale of Udu people to support the Okowa administration in the coming polls. National Coordinator of SOMRA, Chief Godwin Bogban, in his remarks, noted that Deltans have been blessed with a governor whose administrative capability is not in doubt as even the opposition, he added, has given up hope of wresting power from the incumbent in 2019. Chief Bogban explained that SOMRA is a non-governmental, non-religious and non-tribal political pressure group with the aim of complementing the efforts of the Directorate of Orientation and Information towards propagating the good works of Governor Okowa so that Deltans can be adequately sensitised to appreciate why the governor deserved another term. SOMRA commended Governor Okowa for his SMART agenda, which Chief Bogban declared, was spreading prosperity to many homes in the state, noting that Okowa has impressed the people in the area of infrastructural development, massive road construction all over the state, sports development, education, improvement transportation scheme, health care delivery, peace and security, workers welfare and many more. With Chief Bogban on the visit were Campaign Welemu, Coordinator, SOMRA Delta Central, Princess Mabel Ebele Ogwu, Delta North Coordinator, Chief Tony Ekioja, Chief Pius Ghavwan, Coordinator, Udu and others. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
