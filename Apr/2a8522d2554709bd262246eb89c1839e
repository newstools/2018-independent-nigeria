Professor Abubakar Njodi, Vice Chancellor of the University of Maiduguri (UNIMAID), has said the Federal Government has committed N2.67 billion to enhance security in and around the university. Njodi, who disclosed this at the university’s 23rd combined convocation in Maiduguri on Saturday, commended the Federal Government in its efforts towards security of lives and properties. He said: “We are delighted that the Federal Government has clearly demonstrated firm commitment to its onerous responsibility of protection of lives and property of members of the university community. “The action of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) in approving such amount of funds to the university is highly commendable. “This gesture of support would no doubt spur us into greater services and sacrifices to nation and our responsibilities,” he said. Njodi lamented that insurgency had crippled the political, social and economic spheres of governance in the country, even as maintained that its impact was enormous with devastating psychological implications in Borno State. He reiterated the commitment of the university to continue its normal academic activities in spite of the attacks on the institution. “We assure the Federal Government of our total commitment to promoting national development through quality manpower training and insightful research,” said Njodi. He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the special support and encouragement to the university. On fuel exploration in the Lake Chad region, Njodi said in spite of the abduction of three and killing of six lecturers, the university would not relent to offer its services whenever the need arises. 1 comments
