More than 140 firefighters are battling an out of control blaze in Sydney’s south-west. A NSW Rural Fire Service emergency warning was issued after 3.30pm on Saturday for the fast-moving bushfire in Wattle Grove, telling residents there and in Holsworthy military complex to shelter in place. Residents in Voyager Point, Pleasure Point and Sandy Point are being advised by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service to leave south towards Heathcote and to not travel west. Buses have replaced trains between East Hills and Glenfied on the T8 airport and south line, with the Transport Management Centre telling people to allow plenty of additional travel time and to check indicator boards. There were no reports yet of homes being damaged by the blaze on Saturday, a NSW RFS spokesman said. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
