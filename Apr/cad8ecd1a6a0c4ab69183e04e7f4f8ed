Wasiu Jimoh might have been signed as a striker for FC IfeanyiUbah but he may be playing in the defence of the Anambra Warriors. This, he relayed to the media, was part of the coach’s decision to try out many options towards repositioning the club for greater things ahead. Jimoh started out as a striker with Shooting Stars but after finding playing time opportunities limited at his current club, he is trying to adapt himself to his new role as a defender and he is not shy to recount what brought about his new experience. The player, who had a good game against Plateau United and Kano Pillars at the Sani Abacha Stadium, Kano, revealed that it wasn’t that he had lost his scoring instinct but that he was doing his best to help the Nnewi side and that he was open to playing at any position the coaches asked him to feature. “You should not be surprised to see me play at the right back always. It is not as if I have forgotten how to score but the coaches are trying out something different which I will like to be part of. I have been told to help the team in the defence and I don’t have any problem with that. “As a player, you should be ready to help your team in any area you are called upon to do so. It doesn’t mean that I can’t return back to my preferred position which is to score goals whenever I am told to do so,” he said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
