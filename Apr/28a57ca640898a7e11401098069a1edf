Owerri – Rochas Okorocha, Imo State governor, may have begun to think of life after office as he prepares to bow out of Government House next year. The governor noted on Sunday that four former governors of the state – Sam Mbakwe, Evan Enwerem, Achike Udenwa, and Ikedi Ohakim – must have been over-estimated with regards to how wealthy they became after leaving office as governors. The governor told journalists at the Government House, Owerri, that it was a wrong assessment for people to have concluded that the former governors left office as very rich people. He added that none of the former governors could be adjudged rich by any standard after leaving office. The governor’s decision to build houses for the former governors ignited objections. He said the ex-governors deserved the appreciation of Imo people. But some people objected to that idea on the grounds that the former governors had left office as very rich people. Governor Okorocha said: “Where is the wealth Sam Mbakwe was said to have accumulated for which he was imprisoned? “Where is the wealth today? You need to see what the children are going through. Where is the wealth Enwerem, or Udenwa, or Ohakim were said to have acquired?” “Look around and show me where this wealth said to have been accumulated by the former governors is. “It is not true. The problem lies with the perception of people. They have the feeling that once you are a governor, you must have gotten the franchise to acquire wealth, which is far from reality.” Okorocha said he had no bank account or house in any part of the world, adding that he did not believe it was the best of actions to begin to have money in foreign accounts or houses overseas. He cautioned against Nigerians seeing all their leaders as corrupt, and advised them to try as much as they could to appreciate their leaders. 0 comments
