UGHELLI – Chief Emovwa Duku, Chiarman /Managing Director, Palm Orchid, Effurun, Uvwie LGA of Delta State, has commended the Chiarman of the Council, Hon. Ramson Onoyake, for the clean-up exercise being carried out in the local government. Duku in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT  in Effurun said that apart from sweeping of major roads and clearing of gutters and water-ways as the rains set in, traders at the popular Effurun market were also being controlled to pave way for free flow of traffic, especially on market days. Noting that the LG now wears a new look, Duku appreciated the council boss for taken the bull by the horns. “I must commend the council chairman from the bottom of my heart for this laudable clean-up exercise. It has given Uvwie a facelift,” he said. 2 comments
