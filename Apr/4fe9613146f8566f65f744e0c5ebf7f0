Kwara United will be the guests of Rangers International in a match billed for the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Enugu, and it is one of the week 17 encounters that will go down around the country. Kwara United are still rooted at the bottom of the table with 15 points from 14 matches. The Harmony Warriors have played seven away matches in the 17-week-old league with only two points to show for it. They lost five of the matches and pulled draws in the other two. The newly promoted side started the season with a 0-1 loss to MFM in Lagos. In their next away tie, FC IfeanyiUbah defeated them 2-0 in Nnewi before Akwa United took it a goal further to wallop them 3-0 in Uyo. Against Heartland in Owerri, the Naze Millionaires defeated them 2-0 but they pulled a 3-3 draw with Nsarawa United in Lafia before Abia Warriors wounded them 1-0 in Umuahia. In their last away match before Sunday’s match, Kwara United played out a 2-2 draw with Sunshine Stars in Akure. Meanwhile, they will come up against Rangers, which have won nine times in their last 12 home matches with two draws and one loss. In the match-day one of the current season, league leaders, Lobi Stars, defeated the Flying Antelopes 1-0 at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium. In the other two draws in their last 12 home ties, Rangers forced Enyimba to a 1-1 draw in Enugu when they equalised Ikechukwu Ibenegbu’s 22nd minute in the 88th minute last season. This is obviously a match of mismatch given the positions of the two teams on the log. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
