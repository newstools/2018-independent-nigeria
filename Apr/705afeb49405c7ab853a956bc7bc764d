Lagos – The Coca-Cola Co’s Diet Coke overhaul helped drive a first-quarter turnaround for the brand, Coca-Cola has said, as the company delivered a rise in sales in Q1. In results posted yesterday, Diet Coke returned to volume growth in North America, the sugar-free cola’s first quarterly increase since the final three months of 2010. The boost follows the unveiling of a new brand positioning for Diet Coke in January amid long-term declines in the North American diet soda category. The overhaul, which has since been extended to the UK, includes new, slim-line cans and four additional flavours such as Zesty Blood Orange and Twisted Mango. The positive news for Diet Coke came as Coca-Cola announced a 5% rise in organic sales in the three months to 30 March. The underlying increase far outstripped reported sales, which declined 16% on the back of refranchising efforts across Coca-Cola’s bottler network that have hampered performance for the past two years. Overall performance for the Coke portfolio was also positive as the flagship brand delivered a 4% global volumes increase across all of its lines. Classic Coke was up 3% in volumes, while Coke Zero Sugar increased by double-digits. “We’re encouraged with our first-quarter performance as we continue our evolution as a consumer-centric, total beverage company,” said Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey. “We have the right strategies in place and remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year guidance.” 0 comments
