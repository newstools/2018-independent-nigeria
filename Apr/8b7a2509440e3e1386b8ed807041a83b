Joseph Yobo, the former Super Eagles skipper, has urged the national team coach, Gernot Rohr to consider Obafemi Martins as an option as the countdown to the FIFA World Cup tournament continues. Obafemi Martins the former Super Eagles striker who plays for Chinese club, Shanghai Shenhua, scored a hat-trick as his club beat Hebei FC 4-2 in the Chinese League and according to Yobo, Obafemi’s experience will be vital in Russia 2018. “I am not imposing players on Rohr, but I think the likes of Obafemi Martins and Austin Ejide can help strengthen the defective areas. They are experienced players and they know the in and out of Nigeria football,” Yobo said Obafemi has earned 42 caps for Nigeria. He was in the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He did not score any goal for the Super Eagles. Martins, who has played in clubs like Inter Milan and Newcastle United, among others, has been a recurring name in the mouth of most commentators, especially as the friendly matches against Poland and Serbia exposed the national team’s lack of depth in the striking position. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
