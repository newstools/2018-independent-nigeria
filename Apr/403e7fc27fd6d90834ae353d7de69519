Plateau United, from all considerations, have been a poor representation of what a true champion of the NPFL should be. The Peace Boys surprised the bookmakers last season to win the league, even as, MFM, also defiled all permutation to place second. But that is all about their success story as the club has shown everything but the form that made them very lethal last season. Going into Sunday’s week 18 match, the reigning Nigerian champions are at a distant 12th on the table with 21 points from 13 games, albeit with three matches on hand. Just on Tuesday, they were eliminated from the CAF Confederations Cup by Algerian side, USM Algers, who defeated them 4-0. They have earlier dropped to the second tier African club competition following defeat by Etoile du Sahel of Tunisia. With seven wins so far and six losses, opinions may be divided on their season, but given that they are the reigning champions, a lot would have been expected from them, especially in the CAF competitions, where they have lost out entirely. On Sunday, they will be at Dan Anyiam Stadium in Owerri to confront the newly promoted Heartland in a match they should be expected to at least come out with a draw. But that may not be, especially as the champions have been bad on the road since their match-day one 1-0 win of Nsarawa United in Lafia. Since that win, Plateau United have been unable to win any away game, with their last victory outside Jos being a 2-1 win over Sunshine Stars on June 6, 2017 last season. Besides, Heartland can draw strength from Go Round’s 1-0 win over the champions in Omoku this season. 0 comments
