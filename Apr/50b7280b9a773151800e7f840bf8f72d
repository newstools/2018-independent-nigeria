Popular gospel DJ, Gosporella, escaped death on Sunday, April 22.
Gosporella, who is known for his pedigree both in the broadcasting industry and as a gospel DJ, was returning from an event when the accident occurred along Western Avenue.
The DJ ran his Nissan SUV into a truck in the early hours of the day, but alighted from the vehicle with no injuries.
With over three decade experience on the job, the DJ who is currently known for hosting Gospel Zone every Sunday morning on Beat 99.9 FM in Lagos is highly regarded in the industry.
He took to social media to thank God for sparing his life, saying “God is good. I’d like to thank God for saving our lives last night on the way home. I swerved to avoid a car that swerved to my lane at Barracks Bus Stop, Ojuelegba. He was avoiding a parked trailer on the express road. A thousand tongues are not enough to praise you Lord. Thank you, thank you, thank you Jehovah. Please get these trucks off the way to avoid unnecessary carnage on our roads.” 0 comments
