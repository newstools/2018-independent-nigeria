A Sharia Court sitting at Magajin Gari, Kaduna,  on Monday ordered  that  one Shuaibu Umar be given 80 strokes of cane for calling his sister-in-law, Suwaiba Abdulkadir, a prostitute. Abdulkadir,  who had filled a case of defamation  against her brother in-law,  told the court that Umar called her a prostitute after a misunderstanding they had. ” Shuaibu is my husband’s younger brother and  we had a misunderstanding; we exchanged words and he called me a prostitute. ” I want this honourable court to grant me justice as what my brother-in-law said about me has tarnished my image,’’ she said. The defendant, who did not deny calling his sister-in-law a prostitute, added that he spoke in anger and had no regrets. “I was hurt when she called me a drug addict and a thief, that was why I called her  a prostitute and I won’t go back on my words,’’ he said. The judge, Malam Dahiru Lawal, ruled that Umar be given 80 lashes of cane after giving the defendant a chance to withdraw his  statement. “The defendant confirmed calling his sister-in-law a prostitute and is not ready to withdraw the statement; therefore, I, Dahiru Lawal, rule that Shuaibu Umar be given 80 strokes of cane. “This is in accordance with the teachings of Prophet Muhammad which state  that one cannot accuse a person of adultery or fornication except he presents four witnesses who have seen the activity. ” He is to receive 80 strokes of cane in place of the person he accused because he has defamed the person’s character,’’ the judge said. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
