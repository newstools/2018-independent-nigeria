Ado-Ekiti – Prominent Traditional rulers in Ekiti State met Mr Ayo Fayose, the state governor at the weekend where they demand that the next governor of the state must come from the South Senatorial District. The Obas also warned political parties against fielding a candidate outside the Ekiti South for the July 14 governorship election in the state. They advised political parties to ensure they produced a candidate from the south in their primaries ahead of the main election. Warning political parties to take their warning seriously, the monarchs said they would mobilise their people to vote against any political party that defy their demand at the election. The monarchs gave the warning at a meeting with the Fayose, on Saturday where they canvassed their position. Speaking on behalf of Royal fathers from Ekiti South, the Elemure of Emure Ekiti, Oba Emmanuel Adebayo, said they had resolved that all political parties must field a candidate from Ekiti South in the collective interest of the people. “We should have a candidate who should emerge from the south irrespective of political party. That will show fairness. Where a particular area is not considered in the scheme of things, that will amount to marginalisation.” The Ologotun of Ogotun Ekiti, Oba Samuel Oyebade, said the people of the South had waited for too long. “We are part of Ekiti State, and candidate from Ekiti South should be supported,” he said. Responding, Fayose, who said the agitation was legitimate advised the kings to spread the message. 2 comments
