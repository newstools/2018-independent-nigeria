I am honoured and will continue to put time and love into Nigeria, especially the community of Odo Aje. Love.” Skepta was born in Tottenham, North London, United Kingdom to immigrant parents from Nigeria.  He’s the eldest of four siblings; the family grew up in Meridian Walk Estate, a council estate in Tottenham.
