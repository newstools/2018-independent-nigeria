The Lillypond Container Terminal Customs Command yesterday disclosed that it generated N6.33 billion in the first quarter of 2018 as against the N2.40 billion it generated in the corresponding period in 2017. Mr Faruq Abubakar, the Public Relations Officer of the command, made this known in a chat with our correspondent in Lagos. He attributed the increase in revenue to the continuous dedication and diligent performance of the Customs Area Comptroller (CAC), Mahmud Dalhat. Abubakar  also said the CAC had introduced a Customs Processing Centre (CPC) at Lekki and Lagos Free Trade Zones in Lagos. According to him, the annual target of the command for 2017 was N10.6 billion, while the command generated N12.3 billion. He said the command’s target for 2018 was N17.1 billion, adding that the controller was making all efforts to surpass the target as well as  block all revenue leakages. The spokesman said that the command generated revenue from general cargo and containerised cargo. “We have no record of seizures due to the commitment of the officers and men of the command and  the controller had  always sensitised clearing agents on the importance of honest declaration,” Abubakar said. He, however, commended the Comptroller-General of Customs, retired Col. Hameed Ali, for motivating officers, saying this had improved the performance of the command. 0 comments
