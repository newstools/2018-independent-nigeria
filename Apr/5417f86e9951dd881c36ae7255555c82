Warri – Archbishop God-Do-Well Avwomakpa, Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria for the South-South Zone, has charged Christians to get themselves ready for the politics of 2019 by obtaining their Permanent Voters Card to vote out the evil rulers who have brought misery and pains to the people. The cleric spoke during the election victory thanksgiving of Rt. Hon Jonathan Oghenekaro Goru, leader, Udu Legislative Arm at the Headquarters of the Christ Missionaries Crusaders Church, Warri, Delta State. The Founder and General Overseer of the Church noted that it would be wicked and heartless for any Christian to fail to secure his PVC ahead of the coming polls in the light of the current hardship visited on the nation by incompetent leaders. Avwomakpa noted that Governor Okowa has come at a very difficult time and that anybody condemning the governor was doing so in ignorance. He added that but for the prudent management of the little available resources to Governor Okowa, the state would have been in more terrible situation, emphasizing that Okowa has done well within the limit of available resources. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
