Heartland suffered a 0-2 loss to Rivers United in Wednesday’s week 15 match, which further plunged the Naze Millionaires down to 18th spot on the league table. But the former CAF Champions League finalists will hosts Abia Warriors on Sunday in a match they must win if they hope to continue a successful fight against relegation. Since their promotion from the Nigeria National League (NNL) last season alongside Go Round FC, Yobe Desert Stars and Kwara United, the Naze Millionaires have found the going very tough in the league they once dominated as Iwuanaynwu Nationale. Presently, they have managed only one win in their last six meetings with the rest five ending in defeats. The development led to the suspension of their erstwhile manager, Ramson Madu, who guided them back to the elite division, and in his place, Ezekiel Onyegbule was appointed. In their last 12 matches, Heartland have won only four times and drawn twice with the rest being defeats. The consequence is their precarious position on the league table and on Sunday, neighbours, Abia Warriors, will be at the Dan Anyiam Stadium. Speaking to SATURDAY INDEPENDENT, Henry Echefu, the club’s media officer, said that what the club was passing through was a phase, noting that they would not be relegated, further sounding optimistic that they would cage the Warriors. “It was unfortunate that we lost in Port Harcourt. But that’s the game for you. I want to assure you that we are not thinking of relegation because we are not going to be relegated. We will bounce back and against Abia Warriors on Sunday, we will win the match, mark my word,” he said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
