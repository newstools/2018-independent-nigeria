Liverpool star Mohamed Salah has equalled the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Thierry Henry’s record for Premier League goals in a season. The Egyptian scored his 31st of the season on Saturday, the second for the Reds in their fixture away to West Brom. The attacker clipped a neat shot into the net after being set up by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to push Jurgen Klopp’s men two goals clear at the Hawthorns, though the match finished in a 2-2 draw. It was a strike that continued what has been a dizzying run of form from the 25-year-old, who arrived at the club from Roma last summer for a fee of around €42 million. Since netting on his Premier League debut – a 3-3 draw against Watford – the attacker has not stopped scoring. Indeed, his form has been exceptional in the second half of the campaign. Including his goal against WBA, he has struck 13 times in his last 10 Premier League outings, with Manchester United the only club to keep him at bay. Since scoring against Bournemouth before Christmas, he has either scored or provided an assist for a team-mate in every league fixture he has played subsequently. Suarez, meanwhile, achieved the mark of 31 goals in the 2013-14 season, when he played 33 league fixtures – exactly the same number as the Egyptian. 0 comments
