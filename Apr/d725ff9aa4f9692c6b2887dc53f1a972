Wikki Tourists of Bauchi will be hosting Enyimba this weekend with the aim of helping their situation on the log. But there may be more to the game if past records between the two sides are anything to go by. Wikki are currently sitting at the 14th spot on the table with 20 points from 16 matches. They are two points shy of their guests, who are on the ninth spot having though played lesser number of matches. Since 2007, Wikki Tourists have played Enyimba a record seventeen times with the Peoples Elephants having the upper hand with eight wins and the Tourists have won five times while four matches ended in draws. In the 17 matches under consideration, only one away win was recorded and it was Enyimba who defeated Wikki 2-1 in Makurdi on June 6, 2007. Since then, Enyimba have forced Wikki to a draw in Bauchi on three occasions. The first was on January 3, 2009, where they played goalless in Bauchi and the Peoples Elephants piped them 1-0 in the reverse fixture in Aba. In 2012, Wikki held Enyimba 1-1 in Bauchi but the former turned the heat against the Bauchi side in the reverse fixture, pounding them 3-0 in Aba. In 2015, it was a goalless affair in Bauchi before Enyimba pound them 2-0 in Aba. Meanwhile, in 2007, Wikki forced Enyimba to a 1-1 draw in Aba, but that was after Enyimba defeated them 2-1 in Bauchi. On the strength of the results above, the odds favour Enyimba to get at least a draw in this fixture, but if Wikki win, they would have cut down Enyimbaâ€™s dominance. 0 comments
