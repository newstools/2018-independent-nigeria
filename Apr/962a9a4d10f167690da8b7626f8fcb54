Uyo – Edet Ikotdem, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom State, says he is disappointed that no Akwa Ibom person has been included in the list of corrupt Nigerians so far released by the Federal Government.
Ikotidem said he would give up hope on the fight against corruption if no Akwa Ibom person is indicted by the time lists of corrupt Nigerians would have been fully released.
He alleged high level embezzlement of funds by the immediate past administration in Akwa Ibom and challenged the Economic Finance and Crimes Commission (EFCC) to beam brighter searchlight into the state.
Ikotidem opined that if President Goodluck Jonathan had won the 2015 presidential election, Nigeria would have been the worse for it because the stealing, according to him, would have continued unabated.
Emphasising that APC would take over Akwa Ibom in 2019, he disagreed that the state was predominantly Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), explaining that the rating of APC or PDP in the state should not be by their performance during the last local government election, in which the PDP carted home all the elective positions.
“The mistake you make is to have attached ‘election’ to that charade. But what would you have expected? Who appointed the chairman of the state electoral commission? That election was a private arrangement of the PDP that had been concluded. There was nothing like local government election,” he said.
Ikotidem said the next round of election to be conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) would be different, as there would be no malpractice, though the leadership of INEC was appointed by the president. 0 comments
