Tragedy struck in Oyo State on Friday morning, as the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Right Honourable Michael Adeyemo, dies at age 47. Rt. Hon. Adeyemo, a lawyer by profession from Lanlate town in Ibarapa zone of Oyo state, lost his wife to the cold hands of death in 2011. There was a report that the late Speaker slumped and died at his private residence in Ibadan. But a family source told Daily Independent on phone that Adeyemo did not slump, but died in a mysterious circumstance. The late Speaker was in office at the Oyo State House of Assembly for several hours on Wednesday. Late Rt. Hon. Adeyemo presided over the last sitting of Oyo Assembly on Tuesday, and adjourned the sitting of the House till next week Thursday, for members to attend to oversight functions before them. On Friday morning, Assembly members had already converged and about to embark on a journey to where they would perform one of the oversight functions when the sad news came. 1 comments
