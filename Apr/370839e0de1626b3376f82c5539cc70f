Making his remarks at the launch, Alhaji Ajagbe Adejumo, a top PDP stalwart in Lagos and representative of Alhaji Abubakar Atiku at the event, said  Atiku is a bridge builder and a man that has all it takes to move Nigeria to the next level  when he becomes the president of Nigeria. He said Atiku was pleased with the commitment and support of the group to his presidential ambition, adding that with the group support and that of every Nigerian the country will surely return to the path of economic growth come 2019.
