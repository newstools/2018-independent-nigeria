Russia’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee says nine insurgents in the Caucasus region who allegedly were planning acts of terrorism during public holidays in May have been killed by police. The committee said officers in the city of Derbent found two separate groups of suspects and ordered them to surrender. It says the suspects refused and died in subsequent gunfire on Saturday. Derbent is in Dagestan, a Caucasus region where police have clashed for years with fighters in an insurgency that spread from neighboring Chechnya. Russian troops have fought two full-scale wars in Chechnya during the past quarter-century. Also Saturday, the Federal Security Service said its officers killed a suspected Islamic State group supporter who allegedly planned terrorist acts in the Caucasus city of Stavropol. 1 comments
