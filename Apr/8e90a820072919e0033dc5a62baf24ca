Lagos – Petrolex Oil and Gas’ Chairman Segun Adebutu yesterday revealed plans by his firm to pump about $5 billion into the economy of Nigeria’s Ogun state. Petrolex will be constructing a mega oil city in the state. Adebutu made this disclosure to DAILY INDEPENDENT on the outcome of the two-day Ogun State Investors Forum recently held in Abeokuta, the state capital. According to Adebutu, the first phase of the mega oil city, a 300 million-liter capacity tank farm was completed. “Many people thought an oil and gas hub in Ogun State was farfetched and impossible,” Adebutu said. “On December 12, 2017, I declared that Ogun state is now home to the largest tank farm in Sub-Saharan Africa. But that is just Phase 1 of the project,” he added. The next phase of the Petrolex Mega Oil City includes a 250,000 bpd refinery, a lube plant, gas bottling plant, and a fertilizer plant. The project will require investments of over $5 billion over the next five years. To date $330 million has been invested. “This shows that Ogun-state is a front-burner in development, in everything, including oil and gas,” the chairman said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
