British Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered military strikes in Syria alongside the US and France in response to the Assad regime’s suspected use of chemical weapons. In a statement late on Friday, May said: “We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalized — within Syria, on the streets of the UK, or anywhere else in our world. We would have preferred an alternative path. But on this occasion there is none. “History teaches us that the international community must defend the global rules and standards that keep us all safe. That is what our country has always done. And what we will continue to do.” The military action was announced by President Donald Trump on Friday after a suspected chemical attack in Douma, Syria earlier this month that killed dozens. “This massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by that very terrible regime,” he said. “This is about humanity; it can’t be allowed to happen.” 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
