An Egyptian court on Wednesday handed down sentences to 190 Muslim Brotherhood
members for committing terrorist acts in southern Egypt. The Sohag criminal court sentenced 35 defendants to 25 years, 61 to 15 years and 62 to 10 years in prison. It also gave 32 others prison sentences ranging from three to five years. Some of the defendants were arrested in 2015 while hiding in a mountainous area, but 124 had to be tried in absentia. They were charged with carrying out terrorist acts, including setting ablaze electricity pylons and railway tracks
and throwing explosive devices at police stations in Sohag province. All the defendants will be placed under two-year police probation. Human rights group say mass trials in Egypt are not fair, while the government defends the practice, saying that all courts work independently. The verdict can be appealed. A wave of street violence hit Egypt after the army’s 2013 overthrow of Mohamed Morsi, the country’s first democratically-elected president. Authorities accused Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood of involvement in the deadly violence and designated it a terrorist organization. The Islamist group has repeatedly denied the charge and accused the government of oppression. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
