The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has urged the Cameroonian authorities not to send Nigerian refugees back to the Boko Haram violence they fled from. Despite warnings, the Cameroonian authorities had continued to forcibly return Nigerian refugees and asylum seekers, who fled Boko Haram violence. The development, according to the UNHCR, underscored the need to accord international protection to those in need. “We appeal once again to the authorities in Cameroon to refrain from further forced returns and to ensure protection to those fleeing insecurity and persecution in Nigeria. “This is in accordance with Cameroon’s national and international obligations,” UNHCR said. Since the beginning of 2018, 385 Nigerians refugees and asylum seekers had been forcibly returned from Cameroon, the majority of them in March, including 160 on April 10 and a further 118 a week later. In all, the UN agency said it had registered some 87,600 Nigerian refugees in the country, adding, “The forced returns are in violation of the principle of no forced returns or non-refoulement. “They are also a significant setback to progress previously achieved by Cameroon in granting asylum to Nigerian civilians fleeing Boko Haram violence.” UNHCR also said it recognised legitimate national security concerns of states affected by the Boko Haram crisis, stressing that it was important that refugee protection and national security were not seen as being incompatible. “Properly functioning screening, registration and asylum systems help safeguard host country security,” it said. UNHCR reiterated its support to the government of Cameroon to ensure that all those seeking international protection have access to efficient screening and registration procedures, as well as appropriate reception arrangements. 2 comments
