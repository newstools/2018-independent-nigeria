Ifeanyi udeze, the former Super Eagles and West Brom defender, has thumped up Nigeriaâ€™s remaining tune-up matches, especially the ones against England and Czech Republic, as the highpoints of the Super Eagles preparations for the World Cup. Udeze spoke to Brila Fm on Tuesday, saying that the two preparatory games would go a long way in showing the strength of the Super Eagles ahead of their opener against Croatia on June 16. The former PAOK Saloniki of Greece left-back said that the Super Eagles would likely show their exact World Cup abilities during the two friendly matches. He believes that the games would be the proper inkling of how the Super Eagles will perform in Russia. Udeze was a member of the Super Eagles at the 2002 World Cup in Korea/Japan. The Super Eagles are in the World Cup Group D alongside Argentina, Croatia and Iceland. They will open their campaign against Croatia before further games against Iceland and Argentina will confirm whether they will progress from the group or not. 0 comments
