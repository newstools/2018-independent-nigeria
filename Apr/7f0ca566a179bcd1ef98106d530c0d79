Maiduguri – Ali Dalori, chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Borno State, has indicated willingness to steer the ship of the state come 2019 if majority of the people, especially those in the ruling party, call upon him to do so. He, however, would support whoever emerges as governorship candidate of the APC. Dalori was reacting to the recent development in his party about ‘tenure elongation’ for executive committee members from ward, local, state and national levels till 2019, which was rested last week in Abuja. He said, in line with the position of President Buhari, supporting the holding of congresses in tandem with section 223 (1) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and section 17 (1) of the APC constitution, he was willing to answer any clarion call from his people to vie for any elective position on the party’s platform. His words: “I am glad to inform you that the much-talked about tenure elongation of our party executives have been put to rest. This is because, had it been we continued with extension of our tenure, it would amount to breach of peace within the party and illegality. “If Borno people and our leader, Governor Kashim Shettima, say I should contest in the governorship primaries on the platform of our great party, who am I to say no? “But let the time come. I am ever ready to support anyone who emerged as gubernatorial candidate of our party in the forthcoming general elections.” 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
