Biggie gave the House a run for its money, and plenty of money there was tonight. Housemates had to enter the glass booth in turns to try and grab the BBNaira notes that were flying around them. In the tight and confined glass booth, and only at the third round of a process of elimination, Alex bagged the Head of House crown to her utmost surprise. While Housemates clapped their hands of delight for her victory, she nonetheless looked anxious about what it entailed. Having checkmated all Housemates, Alex picked a card that granted her immunity and required that she choose one Housemate to Save. Expectedly, she chose her longstanding friend Tobi to share the luxury bedroom with. He couldn’t cease his praises of her as his hands were joined in prayer. Alex’s card had her Save Nina who was jubilant at the thought of heading to the finale. Later, during the Diary Session, Nina admitted to have always wanted Alex to be a leader, just like Anto, Khloe, Lolu, Tobi and Miracle who all wanted to see her in a leadership role. Yet, Cee-C confessed that Alex was the one person she had ‘zero like’ for and seemed to fear that Housemates would frustrate her, especially Khloe as she predicted more fights. If only she knew that Khloe had warmly endorsed Alex. Cee-C, Lolu, Khloe, Miracle And Anto Are Up For Eviction. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
