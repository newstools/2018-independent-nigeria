Awka – A former diplomat with the United Nations and Secretary to Anambra State Government, Hon. Oseloka Obaze has chided Nigerian youths for not rising up to demonstrate that they are not lazy and remove the tag placed by President Mohammadu Buhari. Obaze who spoke in a pre-book presentation with journalists in Awka said that as the nation’s major workforce the youths should have used the social media platform for communication and shut down the country by sitting at home for a day or two. “If they had sat at home without going to work for a day or two, the country will be in trouble. This they could have done through social media communication”, he said. Had the youths done that he said, they would have won a place in the heart of even those who doubt if they are lazy or not. He said a complete shutdown of the country could have been possible because greater workforce in Nigeria is the youths and that as an employer of labour, most of the people in his employment are energetic and hard working youths. Emphasizing that citizens are what the leadership made of them, Obaze argued that leaders of Nigeria must create the right environment for people to thrive. When the system is dysfunctional, the society witnesses all sorts of upheavals,”  he said. On his new book titled:’Prime Witness: Change And Policy Challenges In Buhari’s Nigeria’ Obaze described the literature as an analysis of Buhari’s first two years in office given his campaign promises and his scorecard. “The collection of articles in this book turns critically on three questions: Has the Buhari administration delivered on what it promised during the electoral campaign? Has President Buhari demonstrated the qualities of responsive leadership? And has he displayed the necessary statesmanship in the governance of national affairs?” The book according to him represents a first draft of the detailed analytical history of the administration’s performance in the first two years. 0 comments
