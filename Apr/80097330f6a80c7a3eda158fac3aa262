Kaduna – Unknown gunmen have allegedly killed two people on Thursday in Asso Community of Jema’a Local Govetnment of Kaduna State. Member representing Jema/Sanga Federal Constituency, Nicholas Shehu Garba, confirmed the incident to newsmen. According to him, “The victims were returning to their village after taking a sick relation to the hospital in Kafanchan. “This will be the third time that an attack will be carried out from the uncompleted Asso Bridge.” “This unfortunate incident is coming less than a week after the killings in Bakin Kogi in Kaninkon chiefdom where six persons were brutally murdered by unknown gunmen. “That these attacks are being perpetrated in the absence of any provocation and despite the presence of security personnel within the vicinity, is an affirmation that a silent war has been declared on our communities by agents of darkness. “I am calling on the Kaduna State government to show more than passive interest in these attacks. “I am also appealing to the Military Task Force based in Kafanchan to work harder to fish out these agents of darkness. “Until the state is able to fish out, expose and punish the perpetrators of these heinous crimes, these criminals would continue on their path of perfidy. “To our communities, one cannot over emphasise the necessity for eternal vigilance. “My condolences to the bereaved families and my dear community, Asso, that has become the latest victim of yet another attack.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
