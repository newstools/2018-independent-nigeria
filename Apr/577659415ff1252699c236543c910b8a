Lagos – La Liga giants, Atletico Madrid will play Super Eagles as part of their summer World Cup in Russia test games in Uyo in May. The Super Eagles will play Congo DR next month before playing England in London June 2 and Chech Republic June 6. However, there is no guarantee which Super Eagles team will play the friendly. Charles Anazodo, while revealing this on SuperSport Monday Night Football, said, “Which of the Super Eagles will play is not known yet. Maybe it is the CHAN team or a mixture of the the home based and the foreign based.” But the match will serve as farewell one for the people of Uyo. Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles technical adviser, described the friendly as a fantastic one for the players and also “a fantastic opportunity to bid Uyo people farewell.” According to him, FIFA regulation stipulates that a player must rest for at least one week after any season before plying any match, hence no decision yet on which Super Eagles team will play the friendly. “It is a great opportunity to say thank you to the people of Uyo. My plan is to start my final preparation in Nigeria so as to say thank you to the Federal Government who supported the team very well.” The coach assured that any home based who impresses would make the World Cup team, even confirming that the provisional list of 35 players would be released on May 14, one month to the World Cup kickoff date. 0 comments
