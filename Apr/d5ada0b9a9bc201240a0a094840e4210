In football, every record matters and there is no insignificant one as long as the round leather game is concerned. In the last five rounds of matches in the 17-week-old Nigerian topflight, Niger Tornadoes and Abia Warriors remain the only clubs unbeaten. Tornadoes’ last match before this weekend’s fixture was a 1-0 win over Rangers at Bako Kontagora Stadium in Minna. They had earlier beating Sunshine Stars before the Rangers Match. Before then, the Ikon Allah Boys were forced to a 1-1 draw by Kano Pillars at the Sani Abacha Stadium in Kano. Earlier on, they defeated Niger Tornadoes 1-0 in Minna, which was preceded by a goalless affair against El-Kanemi Warriors in Maiduguri. On their own, Abia Warriors, even though have won only two matches in their last six fixtures, have not lost a game within the period under consideration. They forced FC IfeanyiUbah to a 1-1 draw in Nnewi before beating Wikki Tourists 2-0 in Umuahia. In their other fixtures, Akwa United held them to a 1-1 draw in Uyo and that was followed by two other draws with Lobi Stars (1-1 at home) and 0-0 away to Heartland. Meanwhile, five clubs, Yobe Desert Stars, champions, Plateau United, Rivers United, Sunshine Stars and Heartland, have the worst results in their past five fixtures. The quintuple have lost three times in their last five games. But of the five teams, only Plateau United have won twice, with the rest on one win and one draw respectively. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
