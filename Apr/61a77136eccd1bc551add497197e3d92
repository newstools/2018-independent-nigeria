The Executive Chairman of BUA Group, Abdulsamad Rabiu, has stated that if Federal Government can replicate its current policies in the cement and sugar industries in the steel industry, it will save about $3 billion annually. Rabiu, in a chat with journalists on the outcome of the recent Africa CEO Forum in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire , recalled that 15 years ago Nigeria was faced with a nightmare when it only produced four million tonnes of cement, but now,  the government’s reforms and BUA’s involvement in the cement industry had raised the stakes to over 40 million metric tonnes thereby saving the country over USD$4 billion annually. Rabiu, who is also the Chief Executive Officer of BUA Group, bemoaned the continuous importation of steel when the raw materials are readily available in the country. The foremost industrialist commended the organizers of the forum, and harped on the need for governments in Africa and the private sector to form a synergy that would lead to the development and transformation of the continent. While noting that collaboration is the bedrock on which more jobs can be created for Africans and human capital developed, he explained that though automation is efficient and saves time, there is need to also develop human capacity to man the ultra-modern machines. He, however, said: “Nigeria now has the capacity for over 40 million tonnes of cement and we are saving the country over USD$4 billion and we are creating hundred thousands of jobs”. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
