Dustin Johnson has been world number one for well over a year now but his time atop of the golfing landscape could be up. Justin Thomas is the man ready to usurp him and he could do it as early as this week (although he wouldn’t officially become number one for two-and-a-half weeks). If current number one Johnson fails to finish inside the top 32 at the RBC Heritage he will lose the number one top spot and Thomas will become number one after the Zurich Classic at the end of the month. That is according to OWGR expert, Nosferatu (@VC606 on Twitter). Neither Johnson or Thomas are playing in next week’s Valero Texas Open as things stand and the Zurich Classic does not give out ranking points as a doubles event, so Thomas would go number one on 30th April. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
