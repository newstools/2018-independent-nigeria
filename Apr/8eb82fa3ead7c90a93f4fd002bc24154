Owerri – Bishop Geoffrey Okorafor of the Anglican Diocese of Egbu, Imo State, has urged Christians not to see the celebration of Easter as a mere ritual, but to let it have a spiritual impact on them.
The cleric gave the charge in his sermon at the Cathedral Church of All Saints, Egbu in Owerri North Local Government Area, Imo State as Christians worldwide commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday.
According to him, the careful placement of the napkin in the grave during the Resurrection signified that Christ is coming back, and advised all believers to be prepared for his second coming by their lifestyle.
Bishop Okorafor urged Christians to not only show great assistance to the less-privileged in their midst but also eschew hatred, envy and the like as part of their preparation.
He noted that Christ’s second coming was to sit on the Judgment throne, regretting that some Christians take God for granted despite his goodness in their lives.
He tongue-lashed the Imo State government, which, according to him, has not only failed God but has disappointed the people. He was particularly irked by the determination of Governor Rochas Okorocha to instal his son in-law as his successor, irrespective of what the people think or feel.
While commending Leah Sharibu for holding on to her Christian faith, the bishop urged President Muhammadu Buhari to match his talk with action by ensuring her immediate and unconditional release.
Miss Shaibu is the only student still being held captive out of the 110 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram in Dapchi town on February 19 because of her refusal to renounce her faith. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
