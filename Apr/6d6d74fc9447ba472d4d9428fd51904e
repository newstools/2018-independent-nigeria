Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles technical adviser, has said that the team won’t be distracted with the ongoing court case against Amaju Pinnick, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) President, by the proprietor of Jos-based Giwa FC, Chris Giwa. Giwa had challenged the 2014 election of Amaju Pinnick as the President of the NFF in Warri at the Federal High Court in Jos. The court declared Pinnick’s election illegal, and having held an alternative election in Abuja, Giwa claimed he was the rightfully elected head of Nigeria football. But the Pinnick led board appealed against the ruling. However, the coach, who qualified Nigeria for the summer World Cup told Soccernet.com.ng that the Super Eagles would focus on the task at hand and hope that the court case against Pinnick would come in his favour. “I don’t really think the ongoing court case against the Nigeria Football Federation President, Amaju Pinnick will affect our preparation for the World Cup,” Rohr told Soccernet.com.ng “Besides, we are confident that the decision will still be in his favour regardless of their plans to distract Pinnick’s administration. “My focus is on Nigeria’s next international friendly matches against Congo DR and the Three Lions of England in May and I believe nothing but the best should be expected from us” comments
