Police have appealed for a man from East Ayrshire to “let us know he is safe”, more than two days after he went missing. Donald Keir White was last seen at around 6am on Friday in Greenhill Terrace, Knockentiber. The 24-year-old Keir is described as 6ft, of slim build, with short black hair and a beard. When last seen he was wearing a blue padded work jacket which was covered in paint and black Adidas trainers. He was also carrying a black Nike holdall. Sergeant Sharon Cadwell of Kilmarnock Police Office said: “We are becoming increasingly concerned for Keir and would appeal to anyone who knows of his whereabouts, or for Keir himself, to let us or his family and friends know he is safe. “We believe he will still be in the Knockentiber or wider Kilmarnock area and would ask you to think back, have you seen anyone matching Keir’s description?” 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
