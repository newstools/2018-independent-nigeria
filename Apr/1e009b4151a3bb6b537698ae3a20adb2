Lagos – Alex Iwobi, Super Eagles and Arsenal of England forward, will be a better player as a support striker than being a top striker. This view was expressed by two ex-internationals, Austin Okocha and Phil Brown. Okocha, a former Super Eagles midfielder, who is also Iwobi’s uncle, said on SuperSport that playing as a support striker remains the player’s best position. “He gives his best as support striker. You will notice that whenever he plays behind strikers, he feeds the forwards very well,” Okocha said. Speaking similarly, Brown, a former English professional player, whose career spanned over a decade, and now the coach of League Two side, Swindon Town, said that Iwobi plays better as a number 10, explaining that he was always comfortable playing at the back of strikers. “He is a better number 10 than striking. When you watch him play, you will understand that he feels comfortable playing behind the forwards and he gives his all in that position,” Brown said. Iwobi has been used intermittently in several positions by Arsene Wenger, while in the Super Eagles, Coach Gernot Rohr almost always deploy the player as a support striker or as a winger. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
