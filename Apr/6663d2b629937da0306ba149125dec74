With Rico Swavey’s Eviction, Housemates returned to their routine although feeling slightly orphaned. And for a good reason too because Rico had always taken care of the kitchen business, which was acknowledged. Yet Rico’s departure didn’t give way to the dramatic scenes the House had gotten used to. If anything, Rico had won the award for spending ten wahala-free weeks in a pure Double Wahala House. As such, he never quite made foes just like he never quite made friends. Later, Anto and Cee-C sat together, and for the third time only, since the start of the game, did they take time to speak together. What appeared to be more of a Cee-C’s fulmination as she blamed Alex for coming in between Tobi and her, ended up with Anto nodding a few times to mark her attention more than approval of Cee-C’s comments. It’s not everyday you see Tobi and Miracle behind the stove, trying as much as they could to put together an edible dinner for their peers. Tobi had clumsily tried to clean up the fridge’s vegetable compartments while Miracle was busy stirring a wooden spoon into a pot. Because might is right, none of the hungry Housemates had the energy to complain about their cooking, and instead calmly resolved to fill their tummies ahead of a long night. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
