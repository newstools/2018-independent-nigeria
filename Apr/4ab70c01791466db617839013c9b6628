Miracle emerged winner of the Big Brother Naija (Double Wahala) final wager challenge. He won the sum of N200,000 wager allowance after picking the box tagged number two. Miracle won the cash reward based on luck as all the remaining eight housemates were instructed by Big Brother to pick a box each labeled 1 – 10 on Sunday night. Big Brother who presented the wager challenge as the simplest of the season presented housemates with 10 suitcases with gift items in each one of them. Big Brother said one of the suitcases contains a cash reward had instructed housemates not to pick the suitcase containing the cash reward. He said if any of the housemates picked the suitcase containing the cash reward the housemate wins the cash reward but the house loses the wager. Housemates were given two minutes to pick and open a box of their choice using the pin code 777. Miracle who seemed to be happy as well as betraying the housemate picked the box labeled number 2.
