The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son Louis Arthur Charles. “The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge,” according to Kensington Palace on Thursday in London. Earlier this week Prince William teased his newborn could be given the name Alexander or the rather less traditional moniker, Jerry. More than 100,000 bets were placed across the UK betting industry on the baby name, with both Albert and Arthur leading the way as the bookmakers’ favourite. Following the baby’s arrival, Prince Harry moves down the line of succession to sixth place. The Duke of York, who was born second in line, has moved to seventh and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to eighth and ninth. Andrew falling out of the top six means he will no longer have to ask the Queen for permission to marry – unlike Charles, William, George, Charlotte and Harry. The first six people in the line of succession must have the Queen’s consent before they can marry on May 19, as set out by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013. The act’s introduction also saw sex removed as a determining factor in the line of succession. It has also been claimed that the royal baby has been born a commoner. Royal historian Marlene Koenig told Town and Country: ‘It sounds complicated, but in the UK, the only people who are not commoners are the Sovereign and peers of the realm, (people with titles like) Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, and Baron.’ It was always thought that William and Kate would go on to have three children. Kate is one of three and had a happy home life with her sister, Pippa Matthews, and brother, James Middleton, and is close to both of her siblings. But William may need to adjust to caring for a newborn once again. 1 comments
