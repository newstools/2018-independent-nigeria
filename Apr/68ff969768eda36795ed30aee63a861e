Asaba – Prominent sons and daughters of Anioma Nation from all walks of life have resolved to formally honour the Governor of Delta State, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, for his sterling leadership qualities in the state. The grand reception, which transcends political sentiments, is expected to hold on Saturday April 21 2018 in Asaba, capital of Delta State Chairman, Organizing Committee, Senator Peter Nwaoboshi, who was represented by the Head, Media and Publicity Committee, Mr Patrick Ukah, said that the Anioma Nation has come together to show support for Governor Okowa who has distinguished himself as a true son of Anioma. Ukah, who was flanked by prominent chieftains of Anioma Nation at a recent media briefing in Asaba said that though the reception is long overdue, it is coming at most appropriate time now that Governor Okowa has stamped his feet in the governance of the state, adding that the celebration is worthy because the Anioma people have long desired to have its fair share in the governance of the state and such prayers have been made manifest in the person of Senator Ifeanyi Okowa. He added that prominent sons and daughters of Anioma Nation from all walks of life will grace the occasion, stressing that the state will also be expecting the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, various State Governors, Senators, Traditional Rulers and other party bigwigs as well as business tycoon. Expressing his confidence in the ability of the Governor to steer the state towards the promised land, he said Governor Okowa is a destabilized man who has taken the entire state as his constituency, even as he highlighted some of the laudable projects of the SMART agenda littered all over the state. Ukah said the organization of the ceremony signifies that the Anioma is one united entity and stands solidly behind Governor Okowa to complete the good works he has started in the state, stressing that although there may be few dissidents, the reception transcends political sentiments. 0 comments
