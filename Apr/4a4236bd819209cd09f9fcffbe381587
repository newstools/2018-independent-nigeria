Bauchi – Registered political parties in Bauchi State have vowed to boost participation of marginalised groups in the political process to ensure they have equal political rights ahead of the 2019 general election. At a one-day workshop in Bauchi on Wednesday organised by International Republican Institute (IRI) under a USAID funded election and political processes assistance project for political stakeholders, the parties reinstated their commitment to ensuring that women, youths and persons with disabilities contest elective positions at the 2019 general election. The workshop had representatives of political parties, government officials, state electoral officers, civil society groups and the media in attendance and was held at Hazibal Event Centre, Bauchi. The aim of the workshop is to help political parties to adopt better governance practices and intensify interaction with their constituents. Speaking at the occasion, the state secretary of APC, Buhari Dasina, said that the his party’s manifesto has made a strong provision for marginalised groups, adding that there is a provision for women and persons living with disabilities to be included in all positions. He said, “It is wrong for any political party to marginalise any group for any reason. For APC, there are positions specifically reserved for women, youths and disabled persons and we encourage them to contest all positions.” Also speaking, the state secretary of the New Nigeria People Party (NNPP), Sabiu Zaranda, lamented that young people were not being encouraged to fully participate in politics, but preferred to be used and dumped, pointing out that NNPP has provided opportunities for youths to excel as all the party executives are young people. 0 comments
