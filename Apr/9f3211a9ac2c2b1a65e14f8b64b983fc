Lagos – Arsenal sacked Arsene Wenger and paid him £9million to leave at the end of the season, despite having a year remaining on his contract. The Frenchman announced on Friday that he was leaving the Emirates this summer after 22 years in charge of the club. The 68-year-old claimed it was ‘the right time for me to step down’, but it now emerges that he was forced out under pressure from the US owners. Instead Wenger lost the support of owner Stan Kroenke, who decided to act ahead of the Europa League semi-final against Atletico Madrid next week. Wenger had no intention of leaving the club, forcing them to pay off the final year of his salary in full. But former Super Eagles captain, Nwankwo Kanu, believes that a big vacuum has been created at Arsenal following the Frenchman standing down at the end of the season. Wenger signed Kanu from Inter Milan in February 1999, and together they won several major trophies, in memory of which Kanu said the Frenchman would be difficult to emulate by his successor. “Big shoes for anyone to fill, playing for Arsenal under Wenger was one of the best period of my career, two Premiership titles, two FA Cups, The Invincibles, playing with some of the best assembled players, influencing millions of fans in Africa to support this great club,” Kanu said. Wenger’s decision will bring to an end a 22-year spell in charge of the club. 0 comments
