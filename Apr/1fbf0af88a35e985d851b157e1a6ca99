West Bromwich Albion have reportedly agreed to sell Salomon Rondon for £16.5m if the club are relegated from the Premier League. In the past, the Baggies have allegedly rejected an offer of over £30m for Rondon from a team in the Chinese Super League, but the Venezuelan international could be available for around half that figure very soon. According to The Mirror, Rondon has a relegation release clause in his contract which makes a summer exit from The Hawthorns appear to be inevitable. West Brom sit 10 points adrift of safety in the standings with just five matches remaining, and there is no prospect of Rondon penning another contract with the West Midlands outfit. The 28-year-old was signed for £12m in August 2015 and 27 goals have been scored in 115 appearances in all competition. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
