“We have no choice than to defeat them on Sunday.” This is the response of Chuka Uwaga, the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) FC of Lagos defender, while responding to DAILY INDEPENDENT’S question on the match against the Pride of Rivers at Agege Stadium, Lagos. When both sides clash at the stadium last season, the Olukoya Boys needed double strikes from the spot by former player, Stephen Odey, in the first half to nail the Pride of Rivers 2-1. The goals came in between a strike from Christian Weli of Rivers United in the 33rd minute. Both clubs will be entering the week 18 match with equal statistics in their last five matches. Both have won three times and lost twice in their last five games, but the guests from Rivers State are second on the log having amassed 26 points from 17 matches. But due to continental engagements, MFM have played lesser number of matches. They have played 14 times with 22 points, which is a better result though. After what is obviously a poor display on the continent, the Church Boys will want to concentrate on the league and start their revival with a possible win against the number two team on the table. 0 comments
