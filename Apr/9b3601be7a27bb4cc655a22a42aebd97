Warri – Pastor John Enaibre, the founder and general overseer of the Kingdom Proof Prayer Assembly (KIPPA), has tasked Christians to prevent the Satan not to use the gap between them and God to torment them. Pastor Enaibre, in his Sunday sermon at the church’s auditorium at Agbarho town in Ughelli North LGA, Delta State, with the theme, ‘Help from above’, said,  “between men and God, there is space, the space is just a gap. That gap can be filled with the word of God.” The cleric, who quoted from Joshua 10; 1-11, said: “We do not see God, but we can see God through prayers and hearing his words. This makes us to understand that hearing the word of God, our faith is built. “When we hear the word of God, we can defeat the devil. When Daniel was in the battle, he filled the space with the word of God.” He noted that “a house with the word of God experiences peace always. Even, if there are quarrels or malice, they used the word of God to overcome the challenges and the quarrel does not last long.” 2 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
