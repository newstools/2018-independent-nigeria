Organisers of the sixth IAAF Silver Label Okpekpe international 10km road race are set to unveil the theme song for this year’s race.
The theme song, according to Dare Esan, the spokesman for the race, is composed by Sefiya Ibrahim, an Abia state-born singer-cum-songwriter, who is a Computer Science graduate.
“With the elevation of the race to a silver label status, we felt the need to improve on what we had last year and make it available for people outside those that will be at the race course to listen to it,” said Esan.
Sports and music have long been closely intertwined and audio entertainment has become a core part of the fan experience, sometimes moreso than the action on the race course.
”Athletes often use motivational music to increase their level of arousal before a race or competition, getting their body moving and the blood flowing,”he said.
The race holds on Saturday May 12, 2018 in Okpekpe, Etsako East local Government Area of Edo State and it is organised by Pamodzi Sports Marketing, leaders in sports marketing and hospitality business in Nigeria.
