President Muhammadu Buhari has left the shores of Nigeria for an official visit to the United Kingdom. He departed Nigeria shortly after declaring his intention to seek re-election as President in 2019. While in UK, the President is expected to hold discussions on Nigeria –British relations with the Prime Minister Theresa May. Buhari’s trip to London is preceding the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings scheduled for 18th to 20th April, 2018. An earlier statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu had indicated that Buhari will also meet the Chief Executive Officer of Royal Dutch Plc, Ben van Beurden in connection with Shell and other partners’ plan to invest $15b in Nigeria’s oil industry. The President is also expected to renew discussions with the Archbishop of Canterbury, The Most Rev. and Rt. Hon. Justin Welby, a good friend of the President on inter-religious harmony in Nigeria and World-wide. Further meetings have also been scheduled for the President to see some prominent British and Nigerians residing in Britain.  0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
