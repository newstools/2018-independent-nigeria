Kiss Daniel and Chidinma Ekile might be showing off their relationship on social media, but they are both reluctant to talk about it.
In a recent chat, Chidinma was quoted saying that
“I don’t like to speak about my relationship or love life in public. There is nothing to talk about me and Kiss Daniel; people can say anything they want to say. Whether I am in a relationship with him or not, everyone will get to know later.
“I find it weird that I am always linked to one musician or the other. At times, it takes extra effort for me to convince people that certain reports about me are untrue.”
Interestingly, her lover, Kiss Daniel, is also adopting the same position about his relationship with Chidinma.
Asked about the two of them, Kiss Daniel, was quoted saying thus “My relationship with Chidinma is complicated and I don’t want to say so much about it presently.” comments
