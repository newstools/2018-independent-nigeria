Lagos – Plateau United will be heading to Algeria next week for their CAF Confederation Cup second leg preliminary tie against USM Algers with their heart in their mouth after they could only manage a 2-1 win on Saturday. Osanga King put Plateau Ahead in the 23rd minute and the Nigerian champions held onto the lead until the end of the first half. But 10 minutes into the restart, the visitors silenced the crowd at Agege Stadium after a long range goal.
But 20 minutes later, Emma James restored Plateau’s lead and every effort by the Peace Boys to increase the tally met with good defensive resistance from the visitors. Based on the result, Plateau United must avoid a defeat in Algeria next week to stand the chance of making it into the mini group stage of the second tier club competition, as a 1-0 win by the Algerians will all but seal their place on away goal rule. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
