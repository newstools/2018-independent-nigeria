The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has inaugurated Marine Litter Marshals to assist the agency in ridding the oceans of unwanted waste materials that could cause environmental degradation and impede safety of navigation on the nation’s territorial waters. Speaking during the flag-off ceremony of the first phase with 120 marshals held at the Nigerian Maritime Resource Development Centre in Lagos, Dr. Dakuku Peterside, the Director-General of the agency, charged Nigerians on the sustainable use of the ocean resources. He added that there were many activities dependent on the ocean; hence the need to ensure it was clean and properly utilised. He said: “The state of health of the ocean is related to the state of our health and our economy; therefore we must stop the indiscriminate dumping of materials in our ocean.” He further stated that, marine litter directly impacted on ocean life, marine habitats, human health, and navigational safety with potential impacts on socio-economic development of nations, stressing that this necessitated the agency to collaborate with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Global Partnership Action (GPA) in 2015, to carry out a scientific study on marine litter challenge in Nigeria. Peterside who used the opportunity to charge the marshals to go to the ports, coastlines and littoral communities and enlighten them on the need to maintain cleaner oceans; enjoined them to also keep watch and ensure that the right thing is done so that our eco system can be preserved. He further warned that the agency would not condone indiscriminate dumping of waste at sea. 0 comments
