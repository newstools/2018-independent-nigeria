Israel’s envoy to the United Nations has said that Iran had recruited at least 80,000 Shi’ite fighters which it was training at a base about eight kilometers from Damascus. Holding up a map, Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon told the Security Council on Thursday: “What you can see here is Iran’s central induction and recruitment center in Syria. There are over 80,000 Shi’ite militants in Syria under Iranian control. “It is at this base, just over five miles from Damascus, where they are trained to commit acts of terror in Syria and across the region,” Reuters quoted Danon as saying. Danon spoke during a Security Council debate on the situation in the Middle East. 1 comments
