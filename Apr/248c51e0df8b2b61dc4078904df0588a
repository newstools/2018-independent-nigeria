The Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria (CIIN) and the Chartered Insurance Institute (CII) the United Kingdom are collaborating towards building required human capital that will contribute to the emerging developments in the global insurance market. Both bodies met last week at the London office of the CII to advance the discussion on building a stronger relationship, knowledge sharing, and best practice as well as other areas that both bodies could work together to engender human capital development and education for the benefit of the insurance industry. Funmi Babington-Ashaye, President of the CIIN, who led the Nigerian delegation to the meeting was received by Sian Fisher, CEO of the CII, UK; John Bissell, COO and Carmen Powell, strategic adviser to the CEO of CII. After presentations by both bodies, they agreed on areas of collaboration, that will enable the CIIN explore options/suggestions from CII London in order to get exemptions at Advanced Diploma level of the CII London examinations, and also earn maximum credit points. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
