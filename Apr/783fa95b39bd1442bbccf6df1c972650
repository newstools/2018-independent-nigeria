Awka – Barrister Chigbo Enwezor, member representing Onitsha North I Constituency in the Anambra State House of Assembly, has said that the chances of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to move into and win more states in Nigeria have never been brighter than now. Barrister Enwezor made the assertion during a meeting of Ward 8 members of APGA in Onitsha North Local Government Area. He explained that the rising profile and popularity of the party was anchored on the good governance and impressive delivery of democracy dividends by APGA administrations, which had steadily governed Anambra State in the past 12 years. The lawmaker maintained that these positive developments have made the party a very good brand for marketing to the electorate in the 2019 general elections, pointing out that many voters in other parts of Nigeria, especially in the South East were clamouring for APGA governments in their states. Barrister Enwezor enjoined party faithful to, without further delay, embark on massive sensitisation and mobilisation of eligible voters to participate actively in the ongoing continuous voter registration exercise to enable them exercise their franchise fully in future elections in the country. Some APGA stakeholders who addressed the meeting included the Caretaker Chairman of Onitsha North Local Government Area, Mr. Patrick Aghadinuno Mba and Mr. Egbuna Amuta. They harped on the need for more aggressive grassroots mobilisation of support for APGA ahead of next year’s general election. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
