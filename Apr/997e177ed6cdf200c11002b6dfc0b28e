A gym instructor, Peter Nwoke, 38, was on Tuesday remanded in Kirikiri Prisons by an Ikeja Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Court for alleged oral defilement of an 11-year-old boy.
Nwoke, a resident of No. 2, Okin Street, Ishaga, Lagos, is facing a one-count charge of sexual assault by penetration.
Nwoke, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.
The State Prosecutor, Ms. I. Solarin, told the court that the accused committed the offence at his residence on August 2, 2016.
“The accused sexually assaulted the minor who is also a student by putting his sexual organ in his mouth,” Solarin said.
The prosecutor also alleged that the accused had earlier shown the minor some pornographic videos on his mobile phone prior to committing the act.
She said the offence contravenes Section 261 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2011.
Justice Sybil Nwaka adjourned the case till May 18 for trial. 1 comments
