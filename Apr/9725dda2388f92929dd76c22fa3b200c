Lagos – Daniel Amokachi and Etim Esin, former Super Eagles stars, have said that the national team should aim to surpass Nigeria’s previous records at the World Cup, saying that a quarterfinal finish would be a soothing balm on Nigerians, who have endured some unexpected performances from the team sometimes ago. They both spoke on Sunday and acknowledged the work that had been done to the team by the Coach Gernot Rohr-led technical crew, but said that the good work should be capped with an appreciable performance at the World Cup. Esin said that the players should do something that will put their names in the history book, stressing that getting to at least the quarterfinal will be nice because Nigeria hasn’t reach that stage before. “History is before the boys and they should grab it with both hands. I think they should aim to reach, at least the quarterfinals and become the first set of Nigerian players to do so. I have my money on them,” he said. In his view,  Amokachi said that the players would get as far as the quarterfinal if they show high commitment and dedication at the World Cup, noting that, that would be the way they could complement the efforts of the coach and the NFF. “They are doing well when we look at where they were coming from after missing two Nations Cups, but at the World Cup, they must try and beat our past record by getting to the quarterfinal. It is possible if only they will dedicate themselves to the task. “The coach and the NFF have done their bits; it is left for the players to put the country first and reciprocate that by playing their hearts out and making Nigerians proud,” he said on Sunday. 0 comments
