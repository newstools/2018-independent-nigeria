Lagos – Barrister Femi Aborishade, human rights lawyer, has condemned the continued detention of Shiites Leader, Elzakzakky and his wife as well as the recent clampdown on the sect, saying the development show that President Muhammadu Buhari lacks the capacity to rule Nigeria. Security agents had on April 16, 2018 clamped down on the members of Shiites, which reportedly led to alleged killings of some of the peaceful protesters and fatal injuries sustained by numerous other protesters. The lawyer said that repression of peaceful protesters is unimaginable under a supposed civil rule. He said the APC-controlled Federal Government has demonstrated, repeatedly, that “it is lawless, having failed to obey the orders of the court that Elzakzakky and his wife be released from detention without trial. “The Buhari-led Federal Government has lost all legitimate right to remain in power. If President Buhari lacks the capacity to remove the heads of security agencies who are responsible for the killing of peaceful protesters, the National Assembly should take steps to impeach PMB for the abysmal failure to maintain or guarantee security of lives. “We call for the immediate release of Elzakzakky, his wife and all those who have been arrested and detained in the course of peaceful protests for the release of Elzakzakky. “Repression of fundamental rights being experienced under the APC-controlled Federal Government does not justify the sacrifices made by ordinary people who resisted military dictatorship,’’ he said. 0 comments
