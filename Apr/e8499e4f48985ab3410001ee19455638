Makurdi – Benue State Inland Revenue Services (BIRS) has shut down the Lower Benue River Basin Authority (LBRBA), three banks and two other business premises in Makurdi, the state capital, for defaulting in the payment of tax worth over N774,543,638.91. Mimi Adzakpe-Orubibi, the BIRS chairman, moved out early on Wednesday to seal off the premises of the affected organisations as measures to ensure they pay the monies owe. Sealing of the organisations followed a court order by Justice Theresa Igoche of the Benue State High Court, Makurdi. Justice Igoche said the order was in compliance with Section 104 of the Personal Income Tax (as amended) and Section 41 (1), (3) and (4) of the BIRS Administrative Law 2015. The premises of the organisations were sealed for one or more of the following reasons: failure to remit payee taxes, withholding tax and liabilities. Adzakpe-Orubibi decried the situation where organisations, including FG agencies, would deduct taxes and fail to remit same to BIRS. Drama ensued at some of the organisations as staff of BIRS attempted to seal off their premises. For instance, the chief security officer at Acess Bank was arrested by security men attached to the BIRS team in an attempt to obstruct the sealing the bank’s premises. 0 comments
