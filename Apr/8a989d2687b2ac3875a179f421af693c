Germany is investigating 431 cases of possible right-wing extremism within the armed forces, local media reported on Thursday. The Military Counter-Intelligence Service was looking at 431 cases, of which 23 were new. The official figures, as reported by the Funke Media Group, came from the defence ministry in response to a parliamentary question from left-wing lawmakers. The ministry said in October 2017 that the army had discharged 18 service personnel because of right-wing extremism. In some cases, Nazi memorabilia had been discovered at army barracks. One officer, who was arrested on suspicion of planning a xenophobic attack was released in November due to lack of evidence. “Instead of turning a blind eye, the government must finally take steps to drain the brown swamp among the troops,” said a Home Affairs Spokeswoman for The Left Group, Ulla Jelpke. Brown was the colour of the uniforms worn by the Nazi paramilitary storm troopers before and during World War II. 2 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
