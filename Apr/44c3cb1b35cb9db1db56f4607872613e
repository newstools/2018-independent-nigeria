Sunday Oliseh, former Super Eagles coach, has expressed his fears over players’ burnout ahead of the summer World Cup in Russia. The former Super Eagles captain reckons that most of the key players in the squad might be fatigued heading into the tournament. According to him, such players as Wilfred Ndidi, Alex Iwobi, Brian Idowu, Victor Moses and Abdullahi Shehu have played at least 27 games in all competitions for their clubs this season and this workload might affect their performance when the World Cup begins. ”I am very optimistic with this group. It is a young group and this season has been very tedious for most of the players,” Oliseh told Channels Sports from Liege on Friday. ”I don’t know if it is an advantage or disadvantage but most of our players are tired because of the season. I think and pray we’ll be fresh for the tournament.” He advised that preparations must be prioritized and warned against a repeat of the controversies in the last World Cups. ”Our team, we can’t lie to ourselves, preparation is very important, we have to prepare right. Secondly, let us hope we don’t have infighting in the team,” added Oliseh. 0 comments
