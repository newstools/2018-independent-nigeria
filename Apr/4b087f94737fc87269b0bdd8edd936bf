Yemeni army snipers have fatally shot five Saudi soldiers in the kingdom’s southwestern Jizan region, in retaliation for Riyadh’s ongoing military aggression against the impoverished country. The website of the Houthi Ansarullah movement said that the Yemeni armed forces had also launched mortar attacks on Saudi Arabia’s southern Najran region. Meanwhile, Arabic-language al-Masirah television network released a video showing Yemeni forces blowing up vehicles belonging to Saudi soldiers in Najran. Yemeni forces regularly target positions inside Saudi Arabia in retaliatory attacks against the Riyadh-led military operation on Yemen. Saudi Arabia and its allies launched the war on Yemen in March 2015 in support of Yemen’s former Riyadh-friendly government and against the Houthi fighters. The military campaign has killed and injured over 600,000 civilians, according to the latest figures released by the Yemeni Ministry of Human Rights. Several Western countries, the US and the UK in particular, are accused of being complicit in the aggression as they supply the Riyadh regime with advanced weapons and military equipment. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
