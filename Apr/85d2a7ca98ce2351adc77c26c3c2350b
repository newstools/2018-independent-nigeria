The top Democrat in the Senate has introduced a bill to decriminalize marijuana across the US. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced on 20 April – a day known for its celebrations of the psychoactive drug – that he would sponsor legislation to remove marijuana from the country’s list of scheduled substances, effectively decriminalising it at the federal level. “The time has come to decriminalise marijuana,” Mr Schumer said in a statement. “My thinking – as well as the general population’s views – on the issue has evolved, and so I believe there’s no better time than the present to get this done.” Mr Schumer’s legislation would remove marijuana from the list of scheduled substances under the US Controlled Substances Act of 1970, effectively reducing criminal penalties for the possession of small amounts of weed. The bill would also establish funding streams for women and minority-owned marijuana businesses, and provide money for research into the public health effects of THC. The federal government’s ability to regulate intrastate drug trafficking and marijuana advertising would remain unchanged. comments
