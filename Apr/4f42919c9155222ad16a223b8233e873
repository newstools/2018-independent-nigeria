For suspecting extra-marital affair with her husband, a 42-year-old businesswoman, Abiodun Rashidat, has bitten a neighbour’s lip, resulting in her arraignment on Friday, at an Epe Magistrate’s Court, in Lagos. The accused is standing trial on a one-count charge bordering on assault, which she denied. The Prosecutor, Sgt. Vincent Ikwuekwe, had told the court that the accused committed the offence on April 8, at about 8.00 p.m, at No. 16, Ajegunle St., Epe, Lagos. Ikwuekwe alleged that the accused bit the upper lip of the complainant, Mrs Abolaji Olanireti, during a disagreement and the fight that ensued. He told the court that the businesswoman had confronted the complainant, accusing her of having an affair with her husband, an action that resulted in a fight. The prosecutor alleged that in the ensued fight, “the accused used her teeth to bite the complainant with force on her upper lip, thereby causing her bodily harm.’’ He told the court that the offence contravened Sections 168 and 171 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2011, which prescribed a three-year jail term for anyone convicted of the crime. The Magistrate, Mrs S.A Gbajumo-Ayoku, granted the accused bail in the sum of N150,000 with two sureties each in like sum. She ruled that one of the sureties must be a blood relation and that they must both have a valid means of identification with addresses verified by the court’s registrar. Gbajumo-Ayoku adjourned the case until May 11, for further hearing. 1 comments
