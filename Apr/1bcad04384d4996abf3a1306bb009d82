Osogbo – The vision and leadership ideals of the late Senator Isiaka Adeleke came to the fore on Monday when his family organised a memorial lecture in remembrance of their illustrious son, who passed on April 23, 2017 after a brief illness. Though controversies surrounded his sudden death, Senator Adeleke died while consulting with leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on his governorship ambition. His death has since changed the political permutations in the state and allowed many new faces showing interest in the plum office currently being occupied by Rauf Aregbesola. Aregbesola’s two terms would expire on November 2018, while Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) fixed election for September 22. The memorial lecture was anchored by Adeleke University, Ede, an institution established by Deji Adeleke, the deceased’s younger brother. It was witnessed by dignitaries from all facets of life, including politicians, traditional rulers, religious leaders, family members and friends. Professor Micheal Omolewa, the guest speaker, who spoke on the visionary ideals of the late Adeleke, described the deceased as a philanthropist, patriot, nationalist and friend of the people, which other politicians must emulate. Omolewa described Adeleke as someone who never gave up on his dreams to serve, despite the challenges in his political career. “His life taught the world a lesson and his leadership style was an important lesson to leaders of all ages,” Omolewa said. In his remarks, Professor Samuel Alao, the Vice Chancellor of Adeleke University, praised the guest speaker for a detailed lecture on leadership ideals of Adeleke. Alao, however, enjoined other leaders from the political sphere to emulate the leadership qualities of Adeleke. Special prayers were also offered for the repose of his soul. 0 comments
