Russian, Turkish and Iranian leaders, who attended the second trilateral summit on the Syrian settlement, should facilitate humanitarian work in the country, Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Thursday. The second trilateral Summit at the highest level on the Syrian settlement was held in Ankara on Wednesday. “We hope that the summit at the end of the day will facilitate humanitarian work. “Be it either through a strengthened protection regime in de-escalation zones, or better access to people who need humanitarian assistance by neutral and impartial organisations like the ICRC,’’ Maurer said at the sidelines of the Moscow Conference on International Security. On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said following the summit that he considered the proposal of his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan on boosting humanitarian aid in Syria timely. “It is right and timely, the work on this issue would be outlined and continued,’’ Putin added. Iran, Russia and Turkey serve as the guarantor states of the ceasefire in Syria, which has been mired in a violent civil war since 2011. The countries are also active participants of the Astana format of Syrian reconciliation. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
