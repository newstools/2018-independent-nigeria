Lagos – Enyimba of Aba have denied South African Bidvest Wits coach, Gavin Hunt, allegation of ill treatment when both sides met in Aba last week. Enyimba had dumped the South African champions out of the CAF Confederation Cup after a goalless game at the UJ Esuene Stadium in Calabar and qualified on an away goal rule following an earlier 1-1 draw in Johannesburg penultimate week. After the match, Hunt, alleged maltreatment, disallowed goals and the poor playing surface in Calabar as the reason why they were knocked out. “It was a nightmare, a disgrace. Things like that shouldn’t be in football. “It’s a joke [what happened out there], I’m not even going to get into it. You guys should come, and then you’ll know about it instead of criticising us for getting knocked out. “We can’t play there… Red cards again, disallowed goal, tackles are … you know, it’s crazy. The pitch, I mean, it was … Anyway, I don’t want to talk about it.” But Felix Anyansi Agwu, the chairman of Enyimba, told DAILY INDEPENDENT on Tuesday that he won’t argue with Hunt, saying that it was not the best for them when they played the first leg in South Africa. “I am not going to go into this argument with the coach. The most important thing is that we have qualified. Have we complained to anyone how we were treated in South Africa? He may be looking for excuses because they are out and Enyimba do not maltreat visiting teams; it is on our record,” he said. Enyimba qualified for the group stage where they were pooled in Group C alongside Djoliba of Mali, Williamsville AC of Cote d’Ivore and Cara Brazzaville of Congo. comments
