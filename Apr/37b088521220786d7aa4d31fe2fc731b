The Israeli occupation forces (IOF) at dawn Saturday stormed Madama town, south of Nablus, intensively fired flare bombs. A hail of flares lit up the night sky in the town after an anonymous civilian car entered and left the town under military escort, according to eyewitnesses. The noisy movement of military vehicles and the firing of flares in the town caused a disturbance to local residents for several hours. Madama town is exposed to repeated IOF raids because of its location near an Israeli bypass connecting several illegal settlements in Nablus with each other. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
