Abuja – President Muhammadu Buhari has put off this week’s meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC). Although no reason was given for the cancellation, it was gathered that President Buhari will be meeting with the National Security Council (NSC) by noon today. The NSC meeting normally holds on Mondays but the Federal Government had declared March 30 and Monday, April 2 as public holiday because of the Easter celebration. This is the fourth time the FEC meeting would be put off since the Buhari administration came on board. The last time the meeting was put off was Wednesday, February 28, 2018. Recall that at the previous cancellation of the meeting, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, had in a statement said it was as a result of the participation of President Muhammadu Buhari and a significant number of ministers at the high level meeting of the International Conference on Lake Chad Basin, at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, for the better part of that day. On August 23rd, 2017, the FEC meeting which was supposed to be President Buhari’s first after his 103-day medical vacation, did not hold. 2 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
