Maiduguri – The Theatre Commander Operation Lafiya Dole, Major General Rogers Nicholas has pledged support for Savannah Centre for Diplomacy, Democracy and Development in its pursuit of the goal to bring security closer to the people of North Eastern Nigeria as part of the rebuilding process for the region.
General Nicholas made the pledge on Thursday, April 19, 2018 when he received the executive director of the centre, Ambassador Abdullahi Omaki at the headquarters theatre command in Maiduguri.
Speaking during the visit, Ambassador Omaki stated that the objective of the centre is to address the challenges of humanity, human rights and crisis prevention. He disclosed that the centre is partnering with the Presidential Committee on North East Initiative to test run a project of Community Policing that will enable well integrated communities to be capable of policing themselves without military forces.
He noted that the project is premised on the need to take advantage of the strength of the existing social structure in the communities, wherein members of a community could work collaboratively with their leaders to safeguard their communities.
Omaki added that the project will reduce the challenge of distrust between the people and the security agencies, as well as help the communities to work cooperatively with the Nigerian Police and other law enforcement agencies. He noted that Yobe and Adamawa states will be used in the pilot study. Omaki solicited the cooperation of the Theatre Command in achieving the mandate of the Centre in the North East theatre. 1 comments
