Lagos – Gernot Rohr has said that despite the seeming poor showing of the Super Eagles lately, especially in the tune-up match against Serbia, he had some players who could make the difference in Russia. Rohr was speaking in an interview with www.omasports.com on some grey areas of the team and pointed to players like Victor Moses and Captain John Mikel Obi as his game changers going to Russia. This is even as the Franco-German coach admitted that the Super Eagles might not boast of the quality of starts like Austin Okocha, Nwankwo Kanu and Victor Ikpeba, but remained unperturbed on his team in Russia. “We are a collective unit, we have a style of playing which is based on teamwork but in every team, you have individuals who can make the difference and in this case we have Victor Moses, we are very happy to have him; we have other players as well, who can make the difference. “John Obi Mikel, our captain, was not around against Poland but we know that with his passes and influence, he can be very interesting and important for the team, he is also our leader, we won a game without him for the first time and we are happy about this. “We don’t have players like we had in the nineties with Jay Jay Okocha, Kanu, Victor Ikpeba. So we have a collective unit of Iheanacho, Iwobi who are playing for the team, working for the team, Ighalo also and even Victor Moses, he works for the team. “When you see the defensive job he does for the team also like he does at Chelsea, even if he does less of that with us, but he is doing it and working for the team but he can make the difference,” Rorh said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
