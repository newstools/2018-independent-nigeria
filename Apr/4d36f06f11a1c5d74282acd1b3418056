Lagos – The All Progressives Congress (APC) has denied a media report that its state governor will contribute N6 billion for the party’s coming congress and convention. The said report, titled ‘Despite Owing Salaries, APC Governors to Contribute N6bn for Upcoming Congresses, Convention’, was, according to the party, carried by PREMIUM TIMES. Bolaji Abdullahi, the APC National Publicity Secretary, in a statement made available to Sunday INDEPENDENT, said the report was not only misleading, but had misrepresented the party. He clarified that during the meeting of the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) and the governors at its secretariat on Thursday April 26, it was pointed out that many of the governors had fallen behind in the payment of their party dues. He said: “While some of the governors have been up-to-date with the payments, a few others have not paid at all. The governors were therefore requested to pay up, especially in view of upcoming party activities. “It is therefore possible that a governor that falls in the category of those that has not paid since inception could owe up to N250 million. “Therefore, it is grossly misleading, if not downright malicious, for your report to simply apply this sum to everyone and multiply by the number of governors.” Abdullahi stated that party dues were paid by all members holding positions, either by election or appointment. “Therefore, members of the National Assembly, as well as cabinet ministers also remit a percentage of their earnings to the party. “It is therefore false to say governors are expected to pay up with state money.” 1 comments
