Awka – Most Reverend Paulinus Ezeokafor, the Catholic Bishop of Awka, has described as a living saint Leah Sharibu, the remaining abducted girl from Dapchi Government Girls’ Secondary School, who was denied freedom on the basis of her Christian. Bishop Ezeokafor, who spoke at St. Patrick Cathedral, Awka, on Wednesday, said he looked forward to meeting Sharibu’s family personally, noting that the girl had shown that she was faithful. The cleric said further that Miss Sharibu had done what many adult Christians could not do.
He charged the Federal Government and security agents to double their efforts to get the young girl out from her abductors.
“If they can release her colleagues, why didn’t they release Leah? Nigeria is meant for us all. We should always remember that our country is a secular state where Christianity, Islam and other religious beliefs hold sway; therefore, none should be given preferential treatment.
“We are appealing to those still holding this innocent girl to use this Easter period to reunite her with her family members. It also shows that her parents trained her in the ways of God,’ Bishop Ezeokafor concluded. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
