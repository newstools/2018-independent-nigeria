Deacon Adekunle Pelujo while declaring open a five-day free medical examination exercise for operators of tricycles in Ajah axis of Lagos, lauded Simba Group for their gesture in contributing to the well being of the public. During the programme, not only did the firm offer free eye test, diabetes and high blood pressure test, it as well offered free mechanical services to the tricycle operators in the area. Pelujo, who represented the Oba Hafeez Olakunle Badiru, the Elejigbo of Langbasa, advised the tricycle operators to always exercise caution and ensure they obey all traffic rules and regulation for the safety of their own lives, passengers and other road users. Mr. Vivek Pendharkar, service head of Simba Group, said the exercise was a way of impacting on the society and rewarding their loyal customers (the tricycle operators). “The main purpose of the free camp check-up is to give gratitude to our end users who have been supporting us.  Our end users are our strength because they tell us what to do and what not to do. We support them by providing them with services, spare parts as well as establish strong personal relationship with them through our TVS dealer,” he said. Mr. Amit Seth,  Head, Tricycle Business, said, “We have been here for many years and we feel this is the right time to use the tricycles as a means of empowering people for  better livelihood. And that is why we have upgraded the product to a higher level – the TVS Dulex Plus – with advanced features, it saves fuel, it is less polluting to the environment and of course offers more comfort. “This means that the rider is going to run the tricycle with peace of mind and at the same time saves a lot of money. Therefore we are improving the condition of families and the society at large. TVS Tricycle has become a respectable source of income for youths and even young graduates. Rather than roaming on the broads, they now have decent source of income while living live with dignity.” 0 comments
