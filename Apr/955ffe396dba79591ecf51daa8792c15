Simon Cheprot and Polline Njeru Wanjiku have set their sights on becoming the first man and woman to win the Okpekpe International 10km Road Race titles two times. Both Kenyans were winners in 2016 to make it a Kenyan double for the third time in four editions of the race. While Wanjiku was absent at the fifth edition last year,Cheprot failed to become the first man to successfully defend an Okpekpe race title,finishing seventh in the men’s race won by Ethiopia’s Leul Gebrselassie. The duo have confirmed their participation for the sixth edition which holds next month in Okpekpe near Auchi in Edo state and Zack Amodu,the director of organisation for the race believes the Kenyans will have it tough completing a fourth double in six editions. “We are delighted to have both Cheprot and Wajinku back for this year’s race,”said Amodu, adding that both athletes ran their personal seasons best at the Okpekpe race in 2017 and 2016 respectively. The IAAF silver label Okpekpe international 10km road race is organised by Pamodzi Sports Marketing in conjunction with the Edo state Athletics Association and the Athletics Federation of Nigeria. 0 comments
