After listening to the full speech made by the president, I really understand where he was coming from when he said Nigerian youths are lazy. Yet, it was a wrong thing to say. His aim is to attract foreign investments, but which foreign investor will be interested in a country where the youths are lazy and sit down all day? Besides, his statement is mostly false. I do agree that there are many who are lazy, but every country has their own share of lazy people. In fact, that is why Nigerians are excelling in other countries. Almost every young person I know is a hard worker. Most will ask you for a job before they ask you for a handout. Nigerian youth are also breaking grounds and exploring new industries, after all, their government really has nothing in store for them. The only jobs being offered are government jobs, and we all know who gets those. Nigerian youths are really not happy with the government statements and they have gone online to kick-start the hashtag #LazyNigerianYouths, which is the number one trending topic on social media at the moment. 0 comments
