Nigeria’s flag bearer in the Rhythmic Gymnastics event, Jade Faulkner, has expressed delight in representing Nigeria at the XXI Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. The 24 year old who is the first female gymnast to represent Nigeria in Rhythmic Gymnastics spoke on how she traced her heritage to the 2018 Commonwealth Games. “I did a lot of research into my family history and it made me very proud to be a Nigerian. For so long I’ve been English and  white and my coach said it will be nice to embrace this side of me. I’m so proud to compete for Nigeria. It really means a lot to me and it was really good to see so many Nigerians in the crowd.” Faulkner said participating for Nigeria was a dream come true and spoke on her plans for the future. “The experience here has been amazing. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. I’m going to take a break right now and let my body recover and then maybe I’ll try some other sport. I’ll like to change sport in the future so we’ll see what happens. “I’ve done Gymnastics for a while now and I feel like I’m beginning to pass over my performance. I want to try something new, a new challenge like some Athletics events maybe…,” Faulkner said. Her Coach Ellen Watson was full of praise for the gymnast who competed in the Team Final and Individual Qualification Sub Division 1- Rotation 1 to 3 to place 10th overall. Watson also relished every moment spent with Team Nigeria. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
