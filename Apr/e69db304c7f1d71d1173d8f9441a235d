When Arnold Schwarzenegger said he’d be back, he meant it. The 70-year-old actor is on his way home after undergoing emergency open-heart surgery last week. Schwarzenegger was admitted to hospital last week to have a catheter valve replaced, but was forced to undergo emergency surgery after complications during the procedure. Now, his agent has confirmed The Terminator star has been discharged from hospital. Schwarzenegger’s rep Daniel Ketchell tweeted: “Update: @Schwarzenegger is headed home!” According to Metro UK, replying to a journalist’s request about Arnold’s condition, Ketchell then wrote: “He was released just before I sent that update and he is currently recovering at home in fantastic spirits.” Arnold himself tweeted following his surgery, writing on 2 April: “It’s true: I’m back! I went to sleep expecting to wake up with a small incision and woke up with a big one – but guess what? I woke up, and that’s something to be thankful for. “Thank you to the doctors & nurses. And I’m truly filled with gratitude for all of the kind messages.” Following the news that the former Governor of California had been admitted to hospital, Ketchell released a statement on Arnie’s condition. The statement read: “Yesterday, Governor Schwarzenegger underwent a planned procedure at Cedars-Sinai to replace a pulmonic valve that was originally replaced due to a congenital heart defect in 1997. “That 1997 replacement valve was never meant to be permanent, and has outlived its life expectancy, so he chose to replace it yesterday through a less-invasive catheter valve replacement.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
