The church wedding of Uche Uwaezeapu, the winner of Gulder Ultimate Search VI in 2009, to his fiancee, Lauren Agokei, took place over the weekend. In a post shared on his IG page a while back, Uche revealed how his wife slid into his DM, ‘shot her shot’ and ultimately won his heart. Uche wrote, “I was on Facebook one lovely day and then I got a message from a girl, checked her profile first, and wow! She was so beautiful. I wanted to ignore but I couldn’t. It was hard and we got chatting on Facebook for about a year, we were so close. At some point, we lost contact for a few months but we found each other again. We met and we became lovers and best friends. I’m so glad I didn’t dull myself.” 0 comments
