We asked the Google Image search engine for this question and you won’t believe what we found. But first, congratulations again to Miracle Ikechukwu Igbokwe (aka Miracle in the house) for winning the just concluded Big Brother Nigeria: Double Wahala edition. The show finished yesterday, Sunday, 22nd April 2018 with Miracle winning the coveted price of 25 million naira, a sports utility vehicle (SUV) that costs N12 million, a holiday trip for two, full home appliances and other prizes. Amidst the whole reality drama and intrigue of passion, emotion and fun games of 85 days, Cynthia Nwadiora, also known as CeeC, stands out with her controversial personality. She was unmistakably confrontational and not afraid to express herself, just exactly as she feels, whenever she feels like. One of such topical moments went down when she adapted her cultural Efik attire and when she lashed out on Tobi with abuses that warranted a big warning from Big Brother. She has taken her personality to a large extent, that has so reflected in her online image. If you do a random Google search of the following phrases: ‘Nigeria’s Most Bitter Woman’ and ‘Bitter Nigeria Woman’, you will be surprised of the result. Take a look:  Is Cynthia Nwadiora this better in real life or is it a show she put up for the #BBNaija show? CeeC finished the #BBNaija show as the first runner-up and going home with 1 comments
