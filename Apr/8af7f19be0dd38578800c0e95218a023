Saturday’s dramatic comeback at Manchester City left things looking rosy in the Manchester United camp but the Mirror reports that there could soon be a fly in the ointment. It says forward Marcus Rashford “is increasingly disillusioned at not starting enough games” and was frustrated to have been left out of the starting lineup for the 3-2 derby win. Rashford has started only five of the last 16 matches and, although he came on for the closing stages at City, “is said to be exasperated with his cameo role status.” The England international does not want to leave United — where he has been since the age of seven — but the Mirror says “Jose Mourinho’s reluctance to give him a sustained run is an ongoing issue that is likely to come to a head if it continues.” It quotes a United source as saying that “if Mourinho is still there next season, Marcus might not be, as he wants to start every game.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
