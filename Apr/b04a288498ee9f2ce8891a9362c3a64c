Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho is ready to let Paul Pogba leave Old Trafford this summer, according to reports. The France superstar has endured a stop-start season at Old Trafford and his relationship with Mourinho has been under the spotlight in recent months. United’s record £89million signing has suffered a rotten run of inconsistent form which has seen him repeatedly snubbed by the Red Devils boss. Pogba has been left on the bench or substituted in seven of his last 11 games, and was again taken off early in Sunday’s shock defeat at home to Premier League basement side West Brom. And, according to the Daily Mail, Mourinho has run out of patience with the 25-year-old and has added him to a list of players to be put on the market. That transfer list is also said to include Anthony Martial, Matteo Darmian and Daley Blind. Pogba was Man-of-the-Match as he fired in two goals to help seal a brilliant 3-2 comeback victory over rivals Manchester City ,which stopped Pep Guardiola’s men from sealing the Premier League title at the Etihad Stadium. But he was poor as United fell to a stunning 1-0 defeat to the Baggies at Old Trafford, and now his selection for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham is said to be in doubt. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
