Describing Dammy Krane as an average artiste might not be far from the truth.
However, this is something the ‘Amin’ singer doesn’t like, as according to him, he is yet to be given his accolades.
Reacting to industry observers who had been asking about him and those saying that he hasn’t dropped a song in a while, the singer revealed that he has released 20 songs this year.
Criticizing his colleagues who have only dropped three to four songs, Dammy Krrane, wondered why they seem to get more recognition than him.
Though the singer has released singles this year, his arrest in a credit card fraud case made more headlines that any of the songs he dropped. 0 comments
