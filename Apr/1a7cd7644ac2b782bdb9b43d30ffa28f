The official media of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) Tuesday
called on South Korea to avoid any action that could harm the on-going inter-Korean rapprochement. Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the DPRK, called a ceremony recently held marking the Eighth anniversary of the sinking of South Korean warship Cheonan “an unpardonable confrontational act of throwing a wet blanket over the atmosphere of improved inter-Korean relations.” High-ranking authorities and officials, opposition parties and the commander of the U.S. troops in South Korea attended the ceremony held at the State Taejon Hyonchung Cemetery. The daily, a newspaper of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, called the ceremony an anti-DPRK confrontational arce invented by South Korean conservatives to completely destroy north-south relations. “Nevertheless, the present South Korean authorities … are chiming in on the anti-DPRK smear incident,” the daily said. The Cheonan sunk in 2010. Of the 104 soldiers onboard, 46 were killed. Seoul said the corvette was sunk by torpedoes fired by the DPRK, a charge repeatedly denied by Pyongyang. The two Koreas held a high-level dialogue on March 24, agreeing to hold a summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and top DPRK leader Kim Jong Un on April 27 in Panmunjom. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
