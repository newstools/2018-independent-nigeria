Asaba – The Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC), Delta State Command, has said that by discovering and destroying about 300 illegal refineries in the last 12 months, it has been saving the country a minimum of N2 billion daily and about half a trillion naira annually. Sam Ego Ezeagbogho, state commandant, stated this at a lecture on the occasion of the visit of the students from Naval War College to Delta State, saying that the average production capacity of an illegal petroleum refinery can be estimated at 30,000 litres per day, which she said was about 10 million litres or 63,000 barrels per day for over 300 illegal refineries discovered and destroyed in the last 12 months. “When this figure is translated into money at the present world market rate of $70 per barrel, it would give you a whopping sum of about N1.5 billion daily at the prevailing exchange rate of N369 to a U.S. dollar,’’ she stated. He claimed that the NSCDC in the state has contributed to the economic development of the country through its activities; she regretted that much of vandalism on infrastructure takes place in maritime environment and stressed the need to enhance maritime security through collaboration. Ezeagbogho maintained that the corps maintains a marine unit and an anti-vandal unit, whose major responsibilities are to intercept and arrest any person suspected to be involved in illegal dealing in petroleum products. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
