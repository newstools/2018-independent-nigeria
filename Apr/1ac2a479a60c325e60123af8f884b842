The Court of Appeals on Monday upheld a life sentence for Chau Thi Thu Nga, former member of Vietnam’s National Assembly for swindling to appropriate assets. The life imprisonment passed was passed in 2017 by the court of first instance on Nga, the country’s top legislature. The court of appeals in Hanoi capital city also ruled that Nga, who was dismissed from the National Assembly in 2015, and former chairwoman of local real estate firm Housing Group, has to make a compensation of about 2.4 million U.S. dollars to her customers. The Housing Group had not been licenced by Hanoi authorities to implement a housing project in the city, but Nga ordered staff to make up things so that a big apartment building seemed to be under construction. According to the verdict passed by the court of first instance, Nga and eight of her accomplices publicised false information about the project to deceive customers and misappropriated about 16.6 million U.S. dollars. The 16.6 million U.S. dollars was paid by 726 housing buyers who received no apartments and close to 1.3 million U.S. dollars was returned to 43 customers. In 2017, the court of first instance handed down life imprisonment on Nga and jail terms of two to seven years on the eight accomplices. The court of appeals on Monday slightly reduced sentences on the eight accomplices. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
