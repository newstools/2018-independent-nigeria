Mongolia Health Minister, Davaajantsan Sarangerel, said on Wednesday that the country would fight hepatitis B, C and liver cancer. Sarangerel made the promise at the Mongolia’s National Health Campaign “Whole-Liver Mongolia,’’ which entered second phase. The campaign is aimed to help people to learn about and fight hepatitis. According to the World Health Organisation, Mongolia has the world’s highest rate of liver cancer and the highest mortality rate from the disease. “By 2020, Mongolia aims to stop new cases of hepatitis B and C, and dramatically reduce the death rate caused by liver cirrhosis and cancer,’’ Sarangerel said. In 2017 a total of 2,312 people were diagnosed with liver cancer in the country of which 1,416 died. Currently, about 400,000 of Mongolia’s population of 3 million are diagnosed with hepatitis B or C infections. Cirrhosis and liver cancer caused by hepatitis B and C is a major killer of Mongolian people, after heart and coronary diseases. The campaign was launched in 2017. In its second phase, citizens aged 16 to 39 would get free tests for hepatitis B and C virus. The initial phase covered people aged between 40 and 65.  0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
