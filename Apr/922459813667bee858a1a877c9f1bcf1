Warri – In a bid to tackle the traffic congestion along the Ubeji/Ifie Road in Warri, Michael Tidi, chairman of Warri South Local Government Area, Delta State, on Tuesday inaugurated a 10-man task force on Road Traffic Decongestion in the busy route. Tidi stressed that the committee, which has Ete Omatsuli as chairman and Kingsley Tonukar in as secretary, should ensure law and order as well as clear all broken down vehicles along the road. While noting that the council would dissolve the committee if its services were no longer desirable, the council boss directed Oribioye Uwale, Secretary to the Local Government (SLG), to communicate the inauguration of the task force to relevant security agencies, with a view to ensuring workable synergy. Omatsuli assured that the task force would deliver on its mandate with the support of authorities of Warri South Council and appealed to Tidi to notify depot chairmen in the area of the mandate given to them. The Shaguolo/Ubeji axis of Warri South and Uvwie local government areas usually have huge traffic congestion as a result of operations of Warri Refining and Petrochemical Company (WRPC) and petroleum depots situated at Ifie. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
