The national president of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Iyalode Alaba Lawson has charged the Federal Government to harness the country’s huge population potentials and make it a national asset instead of a burden, as this would ensure better development of the country. Speaking at a press conference in Lagos on Friday, Lawson noted that although the huge population could be a valuable asset, but if not properly planned for, equally poses a lot of challenges in various areas including provision of infrastructure, adequate healthcare system and service, an appropriate educational system and employment opportunities for the populace. She said: “NACCIMA has taken note of the recent announcement by the Nigerian Population Commission (NPC) that the country’s population is now estimated to be 198 million, thus making our country the seventh largest in the world and the largest in Africa. “Meeting these challenges require proper planning by government at all levels in close collaboration with other stakeholders. “As the voice of business and a national body engaged in promoting activities of the private sectors in all major sectors of the Nigerian economy, commerce industry, mines and agriculture industries, NACCIMA is ready to work with government at all levels to ensure that the huge Nigerian population becomes an asset. “We look forward to a national dialogue on the challenges associated with population growth in a developing economy and the way forward,” she stated. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
