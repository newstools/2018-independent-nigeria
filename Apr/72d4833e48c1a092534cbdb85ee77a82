Christ Glorious End-Time Evangelical Church (CGETEC), also known as Solution Centre, begins a five-day crusade with the theme, “The Snare Is Broken.” The revival programme which started Sunday and continues till Friday, April 13, holds daily at the church’s temporary site in Fagba, Lagos. Prophet Layi Bamidele, General Overseer, said the programme would be a life changing and memorable one as several ministers of God would be ministering alongside with him to deliver participants from different forms of bondages. He also said the crusade would be concluded with a vigil on Friday. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
