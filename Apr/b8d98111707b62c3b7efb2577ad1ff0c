Pastor Abraham Akinosun, President of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) Worldwide, has called on churches to pray for President Muhammadu Buhari to overcome challenges facing the nation. Akinosun made the appeal on Saturday while ministering at the closing of a seven-day prayer programme for the nation at Ikoyi Mountain, Ero-Omo Village, Osun State. The programmer tagged, ‘Nigeria Must be Redeemed’, was organised by  Evangelist Felix Adunpe, General Overseer, Signs and Wonders Prayer Ministries, in collaboration with the CAC. Akimosun, the former Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), said only God could redeem Nigeria from its present predicaments. The cleric, who read from Psalm 122: 6 and Jeremiah 29:11, maintained that God loves Nigeria and would heal the nation of her current socio-economic and security challenges with prayers. According to him, “Leaders fail when people fail to pray. Stop abusing and cursing our leaders, because, as you curse them, the consequences will be borne by all citizens. “If we pray for our leaders, God will inspire them and everything will be all right. We should not lose hope in Nigeria. “Let us pray for peace, progress and prosperity of the nation. We need to pray for economic resurgence and prosperity. We need God’s intervention in this country.” Also Pastor Elisha Alalade, Oke Osun DCC Superintendent and Chairman/Presiding Pastor, CAC Ori- Oke IIkoyi (Ikoyi Mountain), said in his message that Nigeria was facing a battle that must be won spiritually. “All these killings are devil’s work to set Nigeria on fire.  Where there is no peace, there will be no prosperity. It is time to pray,” he admonished. 1 comments
