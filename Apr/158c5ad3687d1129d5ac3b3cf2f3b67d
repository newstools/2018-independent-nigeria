Their marriage is one of the most closely guarded in showbiz. So it’s no wonder the world was left gobsmacked when Jay Z confessed that he and wife Beyonce underwent couple’s therapy in order to ‘work on their marriage’ amid cheating claims. In a rare interview with David Letterman on his Netflix show My Next Guest Needs No Introduction, the rapper revealed: “I have a beautiful wife who’s understanding and knew I’m not the worst of what I’ve done.” According to Metro UK, rumours of infidelity on Jay Z’s part rocked the world when Bey, 36, released her album Lemonade in 2016, and made reference to “Becky with the good hair.” It’s still unknown who ‘Becky’ is however… but speaking to Letterman, the New York native, 48, continued: “We did the hard work of going to therapy and you know, we love each other, right? So we really put in the work. “Like you, I like to believe we’re in a better place today. But we’re still working and communicating and growing.” What’s more, the Otis hit maker told the New York Times last year that he shut down his emotions, and pushed away his wife of ten years when he addressed issues from his Brooklyn past. He said: “You have to survive. So you go into survival mode, and when you go into survival mode, what happens? You shut down all emotions. “So, even with women, you gonna shut down emotionally, so you can’t connect. In my case, like, it’s deep. And then all the things happen from there: infidelity.”  Thankfully, the pair appear to be back on track! 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
