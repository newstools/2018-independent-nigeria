Awka – Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State says plans are underway to send some newly appointed commissioners in his cabinet to Harvard Business School (HBS) in Boston, the United States of America (U.S.A.) to sharpen their managerial and administrative skills for optimum service delivery.
Harry Udu, the Head of Service (HoS), who gave a hint of the governor’s capacity building programmes for workers in the state this year on Monday in Awka during a session with journalists, also disclosed that permanent secretaries and the HoS would be sent to the Lagos Business School (LBS) for training too.
The HoS further disclosed that the governor had organised a retreat for the new appointees to acquaint them with their new working environment, noting that it was important that the appointees understood the workings of the civil service.
Expressing satisfaction that the new appointees were on sound footing for their new assignments, he added that Obiano’s promise of salary review still subsists; pointing out that the state awaits the recommendations of the new national minimum wage committee. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
