Jos – Professor Shedrack Best, Founding Director, Centre for Conflict Resolution  and Peace Studies  of University of Jos, has  declared his interest in contesting  2019 Governorship of Plateau State under the platform of the Peoples Democratic party. Professor Best who also served in the government of immediate past Governor of Plateau State, Senator Jonah Jang, as secretary to the state government, said Plateau is not home for the All Progressives Congress. He told DAILY INDEPENDENT in Jos, that having served as secretary to Plateau State Government for some years, he was fully equipped politically to take the people of the state to their  next political destination. Professor Best said his coming out to contest for the seat of Plateau Governor in 2019 is to restore the capacity of Plateau man to carry the people of the Middle Belt minorities to their pride of place in the scheme of things in the country. He said, “Having served as Secretary to Plateau State Government for years, I have sound ideas on how to provide focus and purposeful leadership to the people of Plateau State.” Professor Best said his state was blessed with enormous human and natural resources that if well tapped for the benefit of the people of the state by the government, the people of Plateau would move to their next destination in the area of development. He regretted that going by the way Plateau people found themselves today, “we have lost the capacity to lead the  people of the Middle-Belt region or carry them along,” and have lost the sense of dignity  and identity  of a Plateau person. He then urged the people of his state to embark on a rediscovery by  taking steps back to where Plateau people  have been positioned to provide the right leadership in governance. 1 comments
