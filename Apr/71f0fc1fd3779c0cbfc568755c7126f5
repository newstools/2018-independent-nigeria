Akure – Mike Omotoso, Labour Party (LP) national chairman, on Tuesday said Olusegun Mimiko, the immediate past governor of Ondo State, was free to return to the party. Mimiko dumped the LP for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2014 after winning two consecutive governorship elections on LP platform. A group within the party, the Voice-Out Vanguard, had accused Mimiko of plotting to come back to factionalise and distabilise the party. But Omotoso said the group was not known to the LP, describing it as faceless. “My attention was rightly drawn to a report on Thisday live where a faceless group spoke on the return of Dr. Olusegun Mimiko to Labour Party. “This personal reply is requisite because the said group, while supposedly condemning the return of the former governor, appeared to be speaking in our support. “Let me state unequivocally that Dr. Olusegun Mimiko is free to return to this party he helped to nurture. “I have nothing against his return and I state without any reservation that his coming will be a worthwhile addition to this party, especially at this time. “He is a brother and an experienced politician whose sagacity will contribute to the growth of Labour Party. “Though rules of engagement have since changed with our new leadership, we are resolute about building a well-structured party where the generality of the people, not few individuals, have the way. “We made a solemn promise to return this party to the masses who truly own it and that we shall make happen. “Irrespective of who knocks on our door, our ideologies cannot be compromised, our resolve for best practices, internal democracy and rule of law is sacrosanct,” Omotoso said. 1 comments
