The club announced on Friday that Wenger would be stepping down from his 22-year stint as manager at the end of the season, although The Independent revealed that the Frenchman jumped before he was pushed with Arsenal considering sacking him following another below-par season. Ancelotti is out of work having been sacked by Bayern Munich in September but confirmed he was not retiring and that he would return to management for “the right project”. “I can say I would like to work again, but that depends on me,” Ancelotti said. “If I find the right possibility, the right project, I would be delighted to continue.” On Wenger’s announcement that he would leave the club, he added: “It’s a great decision, but I think it’s the decision Mr Wenger [made] with a lot of respect for the club and also I think the club have shown a lot of respect. “That is right – Wenger did a fantastic job, and is doing a fantastic job with Arsenal because he is in the semi-final of the Europa League. Great respect and great honour to Arsene.” Despite Ancelotti’s comments, The Independent revealed that Luis Enrique, the Champions League-winning former Barcelona manager, is in pole position at this early stage having already held informal discussions with Arsenal. His wage demands are believed to be the largest stumbling block as he wants a salary in the same bracket as the £8m-a-year that Wenger was earning and while the club are reticent to offer that he does have a number of supporters within the club’s hierarchy. 1 comments
