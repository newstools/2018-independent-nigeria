Rangers International will be guests of Niger Tornadoes in one of the week 16 matches on Sunday. Two points are separating the two clubs on the league table with the Flying Antelopes two steps above their hosts. But that is not all that concerns the two clubs going into the match on Sunday. Since 2007, both clubs have played 15 times in the league and the Flying Antelopes have won on five, while tornadoes have won twice with a whooping eight matches ending in draw. But despite the dominance, Rangers have never defeated Niger Tornadoes in Minna, with some of the matches ending in a draw. The closest Rangers have come to winning in Minna was in 2012 during the first of the two legs that season. The Flying Antelopes silenced the Minna crowd in the 28th minute when Ejike Uzoenyi scored a screamer, but Sibi Gwar leveled towards the end of the match. But speaking to SATURDAY INDEPENDENT ahead of the match, Gbenga Ogunbote, the coach of Rangers, said that they hope to secure all the three points. “We trust ourselves to go to their stadium and win the match. It is doable. If you say that Rangers have never won them there, records are broken one day,” Ogunbote said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
