Lagos – Former Super Eagles Midfielder, Mutiu Adepoju has said that there is no problem with the technical committee of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and Gernot Rohr over his choice of players for the summer World Cup in Russia. Adepoju also dismissed as false the committee’s alleged order on the coach to submit his World Cup squad list following the Super Eagles’ 0-2 defeat by Serbia in an international friendly last week.
He revealed that the committee has not met since its inauguration in January and therefore could not have agreed to query Rohr in any form.
Adepoju described the Super Eagles’ defeat by Serbia as a wake up call, which would spur the team to work harder to reach the desired level before the World Cup, adding that the technical committee was keeping tabs on Nigeria’s World Cup preparations.
“I believe the defeat by Serbia will make the coaches and players intensify their preparations for the World Cup.
“The Super Eagles will excel in Russia because of the quality of players in the team,” he said.
Before the 0-2 loss to Serbia, the Super Eagles had earlier defeated Poland 1-0 in Wroclaw, Poland. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
