A Higher Court in the Indian Capital on Thursday ordered the civil aviation regulator to put a limit on the flying hours of pilots and cabin crew. The Delhi High Court directed the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to specify the maximum and minimum of flying time of pilots under the aviation rules, in the wake of a plea by a lawyer that raised the issues of pilot and aircrew fatigue. “As far as the submission of the petitioner that the DGCA has no authority to grant any exemption or deviation from maximum limit of flying timing and duty period is concerned, there is substance in it,’’ the court said. In his plea, lawyer Yashwanth Shenoy has claimed that the maximum flying time for pilots is around 125 hours over 30 consecutive days but it can be varied as per the requirements of an airline. “The DGCA now has no option but to comply with the Delhi High Court orders, given that many private airline often exploit pilots and cabin crew, which can lead to endangering the lives of passengers,’’ an aviation official said. Domestic air traffic in India grew 17 per cent and crossed 100 million in 2017. Though air traffic is also estimated to grow 15 to 20 per cent this year, the country is facing a shortage of trained pilots. 0 comments
