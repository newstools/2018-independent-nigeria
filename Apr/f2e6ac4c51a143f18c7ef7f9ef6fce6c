Lagos – A 19-year-old man, Friday Oyedele, who allegedly raped and impregnated a 13-year-old girl, was on Tuesday arraigned in an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court.
Though the defendant denied committing the offence, the Chief Magistrate, Mrs. Sule Amzat, ordered that he be remanded in Kirikiri Prison, pending advice from the State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).
She adjourned the case until July 10 for hearing.
The accused, a housekeeper, who resides at Olusoji Idowu Street, Ilupeju, Lagos, was docked for rape.
Earlier, the prosecutor, Insp. Benson Emuerhi, told the court that the offence was committed on January 11, at the house of the victim in Ilupeju area of Lagos.
Emuerhi said that the accused was a cook to the victim’s parents.
He told the court that the incident was reported at Ilupeju Police Station by the victim’s mother.
Emuerhi said that the victim, a 13-year-old girl, complained of headache and was taken to hospital.
“When she was taken to the hospital for treatment, the doctor confirmed that she was pregnant,” he said.
The prosecutor said that the victim told her parents that the accused forcefully had canal knowledge of her and threatened to kill her if she tells anybody.
“The accused covered her mouth so that her voice would not be heard and raped her,” Emuerhi said.
The offence, he added, contravened Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. 1 comments
