Lagos – Two former internationals, Henry Nwosu and Emmanuel Amuneke, have reacted to the recent CAF’s five-year coefficient rating which knocked out Nigeria from the countries to produce two clubs each for the CAF Champions League and the CAF Confederation Cup next year. Both former players, who spoke to DAILY INDEPENDENT on Thursday in a separate chat, noted that the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) lacked what it takes to compete with their peers, especially the more organised leagues on the continent. The recent poor performances of Nigerian clubs on the continent meant that the country, according to CAF’s coefficient rating released days ago, are placed on the 14th spot, two places below the spot for countries eligible to produce four clubs for the 2019 continental competitions. Speaking first, Amuneke said: “When you don’t plan well, how do you make it? The league does not have what it takes to compete with leagues in places like North Africa. We should stop living in denials and know that it has nothing to do with the players but the league itself, which has failed to provide for them,” he said. Speaking similarly, Nwosu said: “It is very sad but if we must correct this situation, the organisers must put the players and coaches’ welfare top on their priority list. They must be paid regularly so that they will not abandon the league; otherwise we won’t match the rest of the continent. We are not getting it right,” he said. 0 comments
