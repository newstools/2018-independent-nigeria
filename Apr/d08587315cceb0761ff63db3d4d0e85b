The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem would open on May 14, Acting Secretary of State John Sullivan has announced. Sullivan, who disclosed in a message on the occasion of Israel’s Independence Day anniversary, said Israel had prevailed over every challenge it had faced over the past 70 years. He said: “On behalf of President Trump and the American people, I offer best wishes and congratulations to all Israelis as you mark the 70th anniversary of Israel’s independence on April 19. “The State of Israel has prevailed over every challenge it has faced over the past 70 years. In just a short time, the people of Israel have created a successful nation that has flourished and continues to thrive. “The United States established our diplomatic presence in Jerusalem well before the State of Israel was born, over 170 years ago. “This year, we look forward to opening the new Embassy of the United States in Jerusalem on May 14 which coincides with the 70th anniversary of President Truman recognising the nascent State of Israel”. Sullivan said Israel and the United States had an unshakeable bond that had endured and grown even stronger over the past seven decades. “As President Trump said in Jerusalem last May, ‘…let us never forget that the bond between our two nations is woven together in the hearts of our people – and their love of freedom, hope, and dignity for all’.” According to him, the U.S. ‘will continue to be a steadfast ally of Israel and will stand together with you today, and always”. President Donald Trump had earlier sent best wishes to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “all of the people of Israel on the 70th Anniversary of your Great Independence”. “We have no better friends anywhere. Looking forward to moving our Embassy to Jerusalem next month!” Trump tweeted. comments
