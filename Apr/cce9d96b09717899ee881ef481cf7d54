Manchester City are looking to end the season on a high by breaking the English Premiership League, EPL, records currently held by Chelsea for most wins, most goals scored and most points garnered in a single campaign. Though the Etihad side secured the title almost a fortnight ago but Guardiola does not want to wind the season down quietly. They thrashed Swansea 5-0 last weekend and want them to keep the momentum, perhaps to set new Premier League records for most wins, most goals and most points in a season. The current records, all held by Chelsea, are 30, 103 and 95 respectively. City’s current figures are 29, 98 and 90. Guardiola said: “It’s not for the record itself – that’s okay, it’s nice – but just to help us keep focus on what we have to do against West Ham, Huddersfield and Brighton. “To play football without intention, sometimes you play lazy and without what you need. That’s maybe why this can help. “The four games left we want to finish on a high and think in a good way and try to win the games.” One thing Guardiola says will not be happening is goalkeeper Ederson taking a penalty before the end of the season. Supporters called for the Brazilian to be given the honours after City were awarded a spot-kick against Swansea. “That’s not going to happen,” said Guardiola. “He’s a goalkeeper, there are other players to hit them. “There is respect for the opponents, respect for the competitions. In friendlies or penalty shoot-outs maybe he can do it, but in a league game, no.” 0 comments
