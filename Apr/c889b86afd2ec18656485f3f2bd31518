Lagos – The Ikeja Electric has partnered with one of its payment channel partners to modify the receipt for payment transactions made by its customers. The company explained in a statement yesterday that the development was necessary in order to further protect her customers from unscrupulous elements, and shore up convenience in electricity bills payment, It added that the online receipts issued for bills paid via the Ikeja Electric Cards channel on computer systems/ laptops feature the word ‘Original ’ &amp; ‘IE’ logo watermarked at the background with the Ikeja Electric watermark randomly displayed on the receipts. ‘’The mobile receipt issued for payments via its Agent App has ‘Ikeja Electric Payment Receipt’ with dotted underlines half an inch from the caption dated with a time stamp. An inscription of the dealer/sub dealer’s name coupled with the day of transaction abbreviated as ‘Tue’ ‘Wed’ with GMT time zone with year – GMT+01:00 2018 is also embedded at the foot of the receipt’’. Felix Ofulue, Head Corporate Communications of the company, explained that the modification would help reduce fraud in the payment process through the channel while easing the frustration often experienced by consumers during payment. “Unfortunately, some of our customers have become victims of fraudsters who issued fake receipts, hence the Company decided to work closely with her partners and come up with this new measure. Nonetheless, we advise customers to make payments with agents they are familiar with and ALWAYS insist on collecting their receipts, for any type of payment made” , he added. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
