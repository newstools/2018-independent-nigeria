The EA SPORTS Player of the Month for March has been named as Mohammed Salah. The Liverpool forward is the first player in Premier League history to win the award three times within the same season, having added to his November and February accolades. Salah’s six goals last month made him March’s top scorer as he surged ahead in the race for the 2017/18 Golden Boot. They also took his overall tally for the season to 29, making the Egyptian only the second African after Didier Drogba to reach that mark in a PL campaign. “I feel good to win it again, we had good results in the month so that’s the most important thing,” said the 25-year-old. Salah is already eyeing his next achievement. He hopes to surpass the record for most goals scored in a 38-match PL season, jointly-held by Alan Shearer (1995/96), Cristiano Ronaldo (2007/08) and Luis Suarez (2013/14), with 31. “I’m very proud to see myself fighting to break the [goalscoring] record for the Premier League. I’m thinking about each game. That’s my target, I want to score, I want to help the team to win again. “It’s still five games to go, there’s a big chance, let’s see.” Salah received the most combined votes from a panel of experts, Premier League captains and fans to claim the award ahead of five other nominees: Son Heung-min, Romelu Lukaku, David Silva, Cenk Tosun and Chris Wood. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
