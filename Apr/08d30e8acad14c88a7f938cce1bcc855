Oche Salefu, the Rivers United forward, has reiterated his desire to continue to contribute towards making the Pride of Rivers great, saying that he was enjoying his stay at the former Nigerian champions. Salefu, who was prized away from the relegated Remo Stars by the Rivers State-owned side, spoke to SATURDAY INDEPENDENT, saying that his move to Rivers United was a right one even as he explained that they needed to start winning regularly in order to catch up with the league pacesetters. “I am getting well with the players and management of this great club and I am enjoying it. I am not regretting it because it was the right move for me. It is just that we need to start winning every time to narrow down the gap from those in front. “Rivers United are a great club with committed coach and players; it is just that sometimes, results will not be what you desire but we still have several matches to go in the season,” Ochefu said. It would be recalled that Ochefu and Mbaoma were two players that were setting the tongue wagging at Remo Stars before the club was relegated. They were almost signing for MFM before a break in contractual discussions led to the duo signing for Rivers United and Akwa United respectively. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
