The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) on Thursday called for increased coordination to address humanitarian challenges in the Horn of Africa nation. Abdul Diabagate, AMISOM’s Senior Humanitarian Liaison Officer, also expressed the need to increase humanitarian facilitation activities and interaction with communities in areas undergoing acute crises and natural disasters. “Humanitarian challenges call for increased coordination and dialogue between AMISOM and partners operating in the recovered areas,” Diabagate said during a day-long training for partners in Jowhar, the administrative capital of HirShabelle state. The training was convened to familiarize AMISOM partners with the Somalia Country Specific Humanitarian Civil-Military Guidelines, which guides the interaction between partners and the Mission. According to a statement from the AU mission issued after the meeting, the training was aimed at fostering partnerships between AMISOM civilian liaison officers and the partners. It also sensitized participants on the importance of observing the International Humanitarian Law, humanitarian principles and International Refugee Law. Diabagate stressed the need to foster greater coordination between the Mission, state authorities and partners, in the area of humanitarian facilitation. During the one-day training the hosts also shared the 2017 Somalia Civil-Military Working Group Report, which was launched September 2017. The report details the working group’s achievements, best practices and strategic partnerships that contributed to the alleviation of suffering among drought-affected populations and displaced civilians. 0 comments
