Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr believes Victor Moses will be the team’s star man at the summer World Cup in Russia, on the premise that he is Nigeria’s most dangerous player. The coach said at the weekend that if there is a player capable of making a difference for the country in Russia, it was Victor Moses. Moses was the team’s highest goal scorer during the World Cup qualifiers, scoring three goals. He was also the best player during the friendly matches against Poland and Serbia. ”We are a collective unit, we have a style of playing which is based on teamwork but in every team, you have individuals who can make the difference and in this case we have Victor Moses, we are very happy to have him, we have other players as well, who can make the difference,” Rohr told Omasports.”John Obi Mikel, our captain was not around against Poland but we know that with his passes and influence, he can be very interesting and important for the team, he is also our leader, we won a game without him for the first time and we are happy about this. ”We don’t have players like we had in the nineties with Jay Jay Okocha, Kanu,  and Victor Ikpeba. So we have a collective unit of Iheanacho, Iwobi who are playing for the team, working for the team, Ighalo also and even Victor Moses, he works for the team. ”When you see the defensive job he does for the team also like he does at Chelsea, even if he does less of that with us, but he is doing it and working for the team but he can make the difference.” Moses scored Nigeria’s only goal in the March friendlies, converting a penalty he had won in the 61st minute in the 1-0 victory over Poland last week. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
