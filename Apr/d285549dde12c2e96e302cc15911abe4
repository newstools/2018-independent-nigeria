Andrew Oche Odoh, a PGA of Nigeria player, is a household name in the South Africa Sunshine Tour – having featured in several of the tours. Although, the Benue-born golfer and former Nigeria number one is yet to win any of the Sunshine tour, his resilience speaks for him as he is expected to be on the course in the forthcoming Zimbabwe Open with a purse of $150,000. The championship billed for April 19-22 will see the winner pocket $40,000 and Odoh has said that the title is open to all the fields. Odoh, who hails from a family of golfers, was basking on his current form which includes victory at Kadinvest Open which held in Kaduna recently and fourth place finish in the David Mark Birthday Tournament at Otukpo, Benue State over the weekend. According Odoh, who finished 20th in the 2017 Zimbabwe Open, “In golf everybody is a favourite.” “I don’t see myself or any other player as an underdog in any tournament, because anything can happen. But, I’m always prepared for the top spot,” he said. “My recent performance is confidence building going into Zimbabwe Open; my performance has improved and I hope to sustain it in the tournament and aim for the top prize.” Odoh is arguably the most exposed PGA of Nigeria player and has won virtually all the Nigeria majors; he was first to also lift Kadinvest Open trophy. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
