Jos – Retired Lieutenant General Jeremiah Useni, the former minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), has declared his intention to contest the 2019 governorship election in Plateau State under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) platform. Useni, who was elected senator from Plateau South Senatorial District in 2015, on Wednesday, stormed the PDP secretariat in Jos with his supporters and handed over his letter of intention to the state chairman of the party, Damishi Sango.
The former minister, who was full of smiles while addressing the state executive members of the party, said that his decision to run for the Rayfield Government House in the 2019, was borne out of consultations and support he got across the three senatorial district of the state, saying that his state deserved good governance that would stamp out crisis from any part of Plateau.
He said that he had garnered enough political experience outside his military experience over the years and was now fully briefed on what his people needed in order to move them forward in the next dispensation.
According to Useni, even though he was not at the party secretariat to apportion blames to any particular person over the recent attacks and killings in Plateau Central and Northern districts during which some people were killed and others injured and displaced, the state government should have used the occasion of President Buhari’s visit to the state to present the plight of Plateau residents in the hands of herdsmen to the president Buhari.
He stressed that he intended to visit internal displaced persons’ camps in the affected local government councils with some other federal lawmakers from the state before they return to the National Assembly. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
