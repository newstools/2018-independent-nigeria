Awka – The Senator representing the Anambra-Central senatorial district at the National Assembly, Chief Victor Umeh has described Senator Omo-Agege’s parliamentary misconduct as a moral lesson to Nigerians in general. He said Omo-Agege has been described as a thug following his alleged involvement in the snatching of the Senate mace recently. Umeh who stated this in Awka on Tuesday explained that the Senate is an institution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria governed by its standing rules and code of conduct. He, therefore, maintained that as a Senator, it is expected that one should abide by the Senate standing rules which precludes them from unconventional behaviours. The former National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance ( APGA ) however pointed out that contrary to insinuations from some quarters that the Senate does not have the locus standi to suspend any member and posited that such was erroneous as well as the arrant fallacy that the Senate cannot suspend anybody from the red chambers. He further disclosed that parliamentary conduct and ethics required that legislators at all levels of government must adhere strictly to the standing orders of the House stressing that Senator Omo-Agege contravened the standing rules of the parliament and met his Waterloo . Similarly, in his reaction to Mohammadu Buhari’s position that Nigerian youths are lazy, Umeh said youths in the country are not lazy but they suffer the most. He was of the opinion that youths don’t have jobs and that people who don’t have jobs shouldn’t be considered as lazy. According to him, “When somebody goes to school and obtain a degree from the university and after ten years his country has not given him the opportunity to get employed; are you going to blame the youths or those who are in leadership “emphasizing that it is the leadership of the country that has failed youths. comments
