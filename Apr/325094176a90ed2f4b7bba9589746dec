Pep Guardiola has talked up the managerial credentials of his Manchester City assistant coach Mikel Arteta, the Belfasttelegrapgh.co.uk has said. Arteta, the former Everton and Arsenal midfielder, has been linked with a return to the Emirates as a potential replacement for the departing Arsene Wenger. Guardiola is not aware of any interest from the Gunners but speaks highly of his fellow Spaniard Arteta (36) who has been a key part of the backroom staff at this season’s Premier League winners. Guardiola said: “My opinion of Mikel is overwhelming. “He deserves the best. We are so comfortable – not just me – working with him. “One of the reasons for our success this season is because Mikel is here. I know there are a lot of names (spoken) of as the next manager after Wenger, but I don’t know the plan for Arsenal. Mikel deserves the best.” Another name linked with the imminent vacancy at Arsenal is Luis Enrique – one of Guardiola’s former Barcelona team-mates and a managerial successor at the Nou Camp. Speaking ahead of City’s trip to West Ham tomorrow, Guardiola said: “He is an excellent and amazing manager. “He can go wherever he wants and, of course, Arsenal is one of the biggest clubs in the world.” 0 comments
