Sokoto – Sokoto police command, in line with the directives by the Inspector General of Police, said they had mopped-up a large quantum of arms and ammunition within the state. However, despite the cache of arms and ammunition displayed to newsmen, no single suspect was paraded alongside the weapons. Commissioner of Police, Murtala Usman Mani, told newsmen that some of the arms and ammunition are recovered in the cause of the arms mop-up operations by the command and men of the FSARS, while some are willingly surrendered in exchange for amnesty. “The arms mop-up exercise as directed by the IGP is a nationwide exercise towards a safe society, and Sokoto is not left out. “61 rifles, 906 AK47 ammunition, 42 double and single barrels, and 1200 cartridges have been recovered so far. “Once these ammunitions are in the hands of unauthorised people, they will be mismanaged,” he said. CP Mani also stated that what would happen to the recovered arms and ammunitions will be decided by the IGP. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
