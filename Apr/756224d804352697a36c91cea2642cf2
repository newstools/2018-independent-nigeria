Two separate suicide car bombs exploded at checkpoints in Mogadishu on Friday, with several members of the security forces injured and more casualties feared, officials said. Police officer Mohamed Dahir told dpa that security forces intercepted the first car bomber at one city junction, causing him to detonate his device. Three officers were injured. Residents of the city were performing Friday prayers at the time of the blast, which sent a cloud of black smoke into the sky. Shortly after the first blast another car bomb went off at a nearby junction, police officer Ali Kulmiye told dpa, saying casualties were also feared in that attack. While it is still unknown who is responsible for the attacks, they bare the hallmarks of militant Islamist group al-Shabaab, which regularly launches attacks on government buildings, hotels and restaurants in the volatile nation in the Horn of Africa. Over the Easter weekend the militants claimed an attack on an African Union peacekeeper base which saw eight Ugandan soldiers killed. In October, more than 500 people were killed when a suicide bomber detonated a truck full of explosives in the capital in the groupâ€™s worst attack yet. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
