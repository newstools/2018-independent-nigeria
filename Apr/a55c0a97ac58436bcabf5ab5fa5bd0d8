ADO-EKITI – Concerned APC Members, a group within the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State, has called on the party’s top hierarchy to disqualify former Governor Kayode Fayemi from his governorship bid over his alleged indictment by the state government and his refusal to resign as a minister. The group maintained that the party stood the risk of implosion if allegation that the minister of mines and steel development, Fayemi,  had bought the John Odigie Oyegun–led National Working Committee of the party over in order to spare  him despite not resigning and being indicted for alleged financial profligacy by a judicial panel in the state. Speaking in Ado Ekiti, the state capital, on Sunday, the group’s Coordinator, Ife Olu-Olubusuyi, said: “We are concerned and advise that the APC headquarters must adhere strictly to its own rules and disqualifies whoever has not met the minimum conditions for governorship as indicated by the constitution and guidelines.” Fayemi and 29 others have procured nomination forms to contest the May 5 gubernatorial primary election of APC in Ekiti State. The group warned the governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, against meddling in the internal affairs of APC in Ekiti, saying that the party was ready to resist all his alleged plot to impose Fayemi in the primaries. Meanwhile, Fayemi, while declaring in Ado Ekiti recently, said that his detractors were only chasing shadows by relying on ‘frivolous’ indictment by the outcome of the Justice Silas Oyewole judicial panel set up by Governor Ayodele Fayose Boasting that he was neither rattled nor wavered by the indictment and recommendation that he should not hold political positions for 10 years, Fayemi described the panel’s white paper as not worth more than a tissue paper. He said that the Supreme Court had adjudicated over several matters with decisions that only the court of law can bar anyone from contesting election, saying: “they said Governor Fayose has indicted me in his white paper. This is just a mere tissue paper. But I have a red card for him in July 14 election,” he stated. 0 comments
