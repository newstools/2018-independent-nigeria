As World Health Day is being celebrated globally, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has urged Nigerians to imbibe the culture of exercise for healthy lives. Dr Wondimagegnehu Alemu, the WHO Nigeria Country Representative, gave the advice during the Health Walk organised by WHO to commemorate the ‘World Health Day 2018’ in Abuja on Saturday. The World Health Day is commemorated yearly on April 7. With the theme for this year’s celebration as ‘Universal Health Coverage: Everyone, Everywhere’. Alemu urged Nigerians to make efforts towards leading a healthy life by carrying out long walks at least 30 minutes three times every week, even as he advocated a change in lifestyle habits such as eating right and exercise to address some of the non-communicable, but life threatening diseases. He listed some of the diseases to include cancer, hypertension and diabetes, among others. 3 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
