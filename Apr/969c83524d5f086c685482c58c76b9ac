Arsene Wenger will leave the club he joined in 1996 at the end of this season. Frenchman Wenger has faced repeated calls to stand down from fan groups over a perceived failure to challenge for the English Premier League title. The club last won the competition in 2004, as the only team in the competition’s history to survive an entire season without losing a game. Arsenal won England’s FA Cup seven times under Wenger. Wenger’s “longevity and consistency over such a sustained period at the highest level of the game will never be matched,” majority owner Stan Kroenke added in the statement. Arsenal Holdings Plc has a thinly traded stock on a London exchange run by NEX Group Plc. It has a market capitalization of about 2.15 billion pounds ($3.02 billion). The company had full year adjusted revenue of 424 million pounds in 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 0 comments
