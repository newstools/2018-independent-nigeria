Lagos – Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles technical adviser, has started growing grey hairs over the team’s defence for the summer World Cup in Russia. Nigeria will kickoff their World Cup campaing against Croatia on June 16, before playing Iceland on June 22 and their lasyt group game against Argentina on June 26, 2018. The coach, in an interview on SuperSport Monday Night Football, expressed his worries about the team defence and not its attack. His worry stems from the injury to some of the defenders and the failure of some players to command first team shirts. He confirmed injury to Leon Balogun, the failure of Willian Troost-Ekong not playing regularly since a change in the team’s coaching department. He is also worried because Tyronne Ebueh is also not playing regularly. “The problem is the defence and not the attack. At the weekend Odion Ighalo scored four goals, Ahmed Musa scored two, Victor Moses scored one. Kelechi Iheanacho is playing well and Alex Iwobi can score,” said Rorh, adding, “I know they will score goals in Russia,” He expressed his confidence in Francis Uzoho as the best goalkeeper the country has for the moment, saying that the player has proved his worth in the few games he has played. He also said that the player has confidence and that it was wonderful that the player did so well in three matches. He declined to give his preferred formation for the World Cup on the premise that his formation would be determined by his World Cup opponent. “Can use any of the two systems. We used 3-5-2 against Argentina. It was difficult in the first half but better in the second. We used 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1 during the qualifiers.” Rohr also informed that available players would also decide on which formation to adopt. 0 comments
