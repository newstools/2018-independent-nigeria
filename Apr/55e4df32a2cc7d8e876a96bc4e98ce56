Abeokuta – A coalition of non-governmental organization on the protection of child rights in Ogun State has cautioned parents to desist from all actions that can kill the moral” and creative abilities of their children through corporal punishments. It explained that the growing laziness among youths has a link to corporal punishments among parents that are emotionally imbalanced.
The coalition under the aegis of Child Protection Network in Ogun state came together to prevent abuse of children from the physical punishment which they noted had affected the youths by making them lose self-esteem.
The state coordinator of the network, Mr. Olakunle Sanni, said at a press conference that his group was not against cultural practices, rather it was campaigning to ensure that the effects of corporal punishment were reduced to the barest minimum, noting that the coalition would take the campaign to schools and churches.
Sanni said the group had attended to over 56 cases of child abuse in the last one year across Ogun state.
Secretary of the coalition, Dr.Bukola Oladele, hinted that corporal punishment was associated with parents that are not emotionally balanced stating that parents must find other means of punishment but train their children.
On her part, representative of the Nurses Association in Ogun State at the event, Mrs. Margaret Erubami explained that most children being abused are the products of unwanted pregnancy and called on Nigerians to embrace family planning methods. 0 comments
