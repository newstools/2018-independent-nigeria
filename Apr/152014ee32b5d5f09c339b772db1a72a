Istanbul Court has ordered the Maltese-flagged Vitaspirit ship be seized after it collided into a waterfront mansion worth millions on Istanbul’s Bosphorus Strait, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency reported. The 18th-century Hekimbasi Salih Efendi mansion belongs to the grandchildren of an Ottoman-era nobleman, Anadolu said on Tuesday. The owners took the incident to court. The ship, towed to a docking station in Istanbul, would be banned from sailing until its owners cover the 50 million dollars in repair costs, according to Anadolu. The mansion was badly damaged with the upper floors almost entirely destroyed in the incident, which occurred on Saturday. The owners of the ship have 10 days to cover the loss at the mansion or face seizure of the ship, according to Turkish law. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
