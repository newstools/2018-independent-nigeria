The hard-line Islamic Taliban movement has rejected the offer of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to participate in Afghanistan’s parliamentary and local elections, local media reported on Monday. The upcoming elections in Afghanistan are slated for October, while the registration of candidates started on April 14. The Taliban slammed the upcoming elections, saying that only those who are approved by the U.S. could gain power in the country, while also claiming that people have been “cheated” at the previous vote. The radical group also urged the Afghan nation to boycott the elections and noted that the country is “occupied” by foreign forces. Ghani unveiled his plans to launch peace talks with the Taliban, starting with a truce and possibly ending with the movement’s recognition as a party and their participation in elections in February. In return, the Taliban would have to recognise the current Afghan government and constitution, which proved to be a stumbling block in the past attempts to negotiate. Afghanistan has long been suffering from political, social and security instability due to the activity of the Taliban and the Islamic State terrorist group. To address this issue, the international community has hosted a number of conferences to attempt to achieve peace in the war-ravaged country. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
