At a time, it almost seemed like Davido could not walk through a Nigerian airport without causing a scene – and not the good one. If it is not his baby mama trying to get her baby back, it is his entourage beating up airport personnel. I believe his PR manager has taken note of the trend and has worked up a good PR plan. This week, some Muritala Muhammed airport workers took out time to express appreciation to musician, Davido for paying for their colleague’s surgery fees by carrying placards thanking him as he arrived at the airport. Quickly, Davido was on Snapchat to reveal why the airport staffs were praising him. According to Davido, he gave out 1.5 million Naira for the surgery of a staff of the airport who had been sick and was at the point of death. Yes, it was a PR stunt, but a lifesaving one. Kudos to Davido 0 comments
