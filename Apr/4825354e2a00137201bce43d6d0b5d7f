Slovakian Interior Minister, Tomas Drucker, announced his resignation on Monday amid pressure from anti-government protesters just three-and-a-half weeks after taking office. Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Slovakiaâ€™s capital, Bratislava, on Sunday, demanding answers to the killing of investigative journalist, Jan Kuciak, and the dismissal of Police President, Tibor Gaspar, for his handling of the case. Drucker, who opposed removing Gaspar, stepped down to prevent society from polarising further. Kuciak was shot dead at his home, along with his girlfriend, in February while he was working on a story about links between the Slovak government and Italian mafia. The Central European country was thrown into political upheaval as a result of the scandal, with Prime Minister Robert Fico and Interior Minister, Robert Kalinak, resigning in March amid cracks in the ruling coalition. Fico has been replaced by his deputy and fellow party member, Peter Pellegrini. An early election has, for now, been ruled out, a decision that has caused widespread anger. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
