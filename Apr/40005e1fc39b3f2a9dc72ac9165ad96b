Abuja – President Muhammadu Buhari has paid tribute to Nigeria’s foremost social critic and selfless legal luminary, late Gani Fawehinmi, on his 80th posthumous birthday. Buhari described the late legal icon ‘‘as a true conscience of the nation, defender of democracy and people’s rights advocate.” A statement by his media aide, Garba Shehu, quoted Buhari as saying, “As the world posthumously marks the 80th birthday of Chief Fawehinmi, President Buhari fondly remembers the legendary patriot for his altruistic services to the nation, which continue to be sorely missed. ‘‘The late ‘Senior Advocate of the Masses’ was not an arm-chair critic, nor a rabble rouser who fomented trouble for its sake, but a serious minded, articulate, cerebral and compassionate promoter of fundamental human rights, social justice, equity, fair play and national development. “Gani was an extraordinary human being and a great reference for all progressive elements in the society. He dared death and incarceration and was forced into prison 40 times without bowing to intimidation and molestation. ‘‘He fought for and stood by democracy with every ounce of his blood and immense intellect. He deserves a lingering respect,” the president said in his tribute. Although the fearless legal author and celebrated philanthropist passed on nine years ago, President Buhari admonishes Nigerians, young and old, to imbibe the good deeds of the Ondo State born detribalized and learned man and also a Muslim leader, “for his doggedness, incorruptibility and fervent belief in the unity and progress of Nigeria as an entity.” He noted that Chief Fawehinmi, who would have been 80 years old on April 22, 2018, “would never be forgotten as a committed pacesetter and pathfinder for the democracy that we practise today.” 0 comments
