Nigeria’s boxer Yetunde Odunuga on Wednesday qualified for the semi-finals in the women’s boxing event of the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia. Competing in the lightweight class (60kg), Odunuga was awarded the fight against Caroline Veyre of Canada following a verdict of Referee Stop Contest (RSC). Veyre was ahead in the score card in both round one and two before the contest was stopped. She dominated round one 10-9, 9-10, 10-9, 10-9, 10-9 and edged round two 9-10, 10-9, 10-9, 10-9, 9-10. The 20-year-old Odunuga, who is now guaranteed at least a bronze medal for making it to the semi-final, will face Paige Murney of England on Friday. Another Nigerian female boxer, Ayisat Oriyomi, will hope to advance to the semi-finals when she confronts Carly McNaul of Northern Ireland also on Wednesday in the flyweight (51kg) category. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
