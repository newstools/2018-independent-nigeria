The swollen St. John River in New Brunswick continues to rise, flooding streets and properties and forcing people from their homes. By Saturday morning the river was 1.7 metres above flood stage in Fredericton — approaching levels hit during the last major flood in 2008 — and rain is forecast through the weekend. Geoffrey Downey, a spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, says the Red Cross helped evacuate 10 homes overnight, while others have left on their own to stay with relatives and friends. Many roads and highways are covered by the fast flowing water, and Downey says one man near Fredericton had to abandon his vehicle after ignoring a barricade. According to Theprovince.com, the storied Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton is now half-surrounded by water, and staff are closely monitoring measures designed to keep the water out. 0 comments
