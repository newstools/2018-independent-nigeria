Wilfred Ndidi, the Super Eagles and Leicester City midfielder, says Argentine Lionel Messi is unstoppable going to the World Cup, noting that Nigerian players would target wins in their first two matches against Croatia and Iceland. Ndidi, who spoke to FIFA World Cup Russia Magazine, said that it was imperative that Nigeria face Argentina with the two wins already in their kitty. ‘’Argentina is very good, for me I will say Messi is unstoppable. He is the best player in the world. ‘’We just have to try and win, give it all in our first two games before we face Argentina.” Meanwhile, Captain John Obi Mikel said they were not traveling to Russia just to make up the numbers but to make history, which means they are targeting at least a place in the semifinals of the World Cup. ‘’I think we are in a group where we can do something. It depends on our preparations and how much we want it, not just we have qualified let’s just go and play the World Cup. ‘’We want to make history, we want to do well. We want to make sure we go there believing we can beat Argentina, Croatia and Iceland,’’ added Mikel. 0 comments
