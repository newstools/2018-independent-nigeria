Lagos – Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries Football Club of Lagos are walking tight rope in the CAF Confederation Cup after losing 0-1 at home to Djoliba of Mali on Sunday. The Olukoya Boys were pegged in the dying minutes by the visitors and thus must win the Malians by at least 2-0 next week in Bamako to qualify for the mini league stage. MFM dominated the match and severally went close to scoring but they were undone by poor marksmanship. The visitors endured the attack and MFM had to pay for it when Djoliba scored through counter attack to seal the win. Recall that on Saturday, Plateau United defeated USM Algers 2-1 at the same stadium and must avoid defeat in Algiers next week to progress. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
