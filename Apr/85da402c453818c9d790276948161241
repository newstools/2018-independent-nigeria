Lagos – In a bid to encourage students to excel in their studies, RB Educational Books Limited will be hosting ‘Lagos State Academic Competition And Award Of Excellent Academic Performance’ from Monday, April 30, to Friday May 4. The competition, according to the organisers, is restricted to Nigerian curriculum drawn up by the Nigerian Educational Research and Development Council (NERDC), whereby pupils in upper primary (Basic 4 to 6) across the federation who had earlier sent their entries, will write a test in English Language, Mathematics and General Paper as the first phase. It will be followed by a televised oral competition, being the final lap that would be witnessed by several dignitaries and parents. Rotimi Babalola, managing director of RB Educational Books, stated that: “The event is aimed at providing a competitive head-start; steadily culminating in identifying, celebrating and rewarding industry and merit among schools and pupils in Lagos. “It is important to individuate this project from the competition that schools in Lagos are used to. The goal is defined. In the next five years, RB Books, with the co-sponsors of this programme, would give scholarship to about 100 pupils and students in Lagos every year. “We are building that platform and we see it as a corporate social responsibility. In this year’s event, specifically, every participating school will be duly rewarded with worthy gifts. There is no loser in the real sense.” 0 comments
