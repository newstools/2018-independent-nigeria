The German government has filed an application to have the country’s theatres and orchestras added to UNESCO’s List of Intangible Cultural Heritage, its Bonn-based German Commission said on Tuesday. “Germany has the richest theatre landscape in the world,” said Ulrich Khuan, the Head of the German Association of Stage Workers. Khuan added that the theatres and orchestras were important spaces for free expression, public debate and critical reflection in the country. The German Commission for UNESCO said on Tuesday that the Foreign Ministry had submitted the request to UNESCO’s Paris headquarters, and that a jury would decide whether to add the country’s theatres and orchestras to its lists in 2019. The body’s acknowledgement of intangible cultural heritage is a way of ensuring better protection of the sites and the awareness of their significance. Cultural products out of Germany that already made it on to UNESCO’s lists include falconry; organ craftsmanship and music; and the idea and practice of organising shared interests in co-operatives. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
