The All Progressives Congress (APC) has joined Christians in Nigeria and across the world to celebrate Easter, which commemorates the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. In line with the true essence of Easter, the party has urged the Christian faithful to take cognisance of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the Cross of Cavalry for mankind’s sins. The party, in its message, said: “We call on all, irrespective of religious affiliations, to emulate the virtues of Jesus Christ as epitomised by his life of understanding, tolerance and sacrifice. “Only then will we co-exist peacefully as a nation and collectively achieve the Nigeria of our dreams. “As we gather around family, friends and loved ones for the festivities, we also urge Nigerians to remember in our thoughts and prayers, the abducted school children who remain in the captivity of terrorists. “We assure of the Federal Government’s solid commitment to ensure their safe release and bring lasting peace to the country’s North East.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
