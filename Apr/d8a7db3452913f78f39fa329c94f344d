Lagos – Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles Technical Adviser, is expected to release his provisional World Cup list by the middle of May. However, a week after releasing the provisional list of 30 players, the second phase of the summer World Cup preparation will start on May 22 in Abuja, with the invited players reporting to camp. The team will play Congo DR in Abuja on May 27 before travelling to London to play England in a friendly on June 02, 2018. However, Rohr has revealed that only a collective defensinve setup can cage Argentina star, Lionel Messi. Nigeria will play their last group game against Argentina at the summer World Cup in Russia on June 26, 2018. Before playing Argentina, Nigeria will open their World Cup campaign against Croatia on June 16 and Iceland June 22. Rohr, who is working on a plan on how to stop Messi said, believes that it was only a collective defensive setup that could stop Messi from hurting Super Eaglrs and not one-on-one marking. “The only solution against Messi is a collective and not an individual solution,” he said, adding, “If Argentina wins its first two games, Messi may not want to play against us. “In the alternative that he plays against us, nothing is impossible. The only solution against Messi is a collective and not an individual solution. We will have time to observe.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
