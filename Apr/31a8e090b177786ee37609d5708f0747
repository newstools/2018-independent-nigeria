Makurdi – Herdsmen on Friday night attacked Guma Local Government Area (LGA) of Benue state, killing about twenty-two persons. Samuel Ortom, the state governor hails from Guma Local Government. The area has been under constant attack by herdsmen since 2011. The herdsmen attacked Tse-Abi, Tse-Ginde, Tse-Peviv, Tse-Ikyo, Agenke and Gbenke communities, all in Saghev ward of the LGA. Eyewitness told Sunday INDEPENDENT that the herdsmen who were dressed in army uniform killed no fewer than twenty-two persons, adding that the rampaging herdsmen also set about eighty houses on fire. Asked if he could authoritatively state whether the attackers were soldiers as alleged by farmers fleeing the area, the eyewitness said it was difficult to say. He lamented that since the herdsmen always attacked communities dressed in army uniform it would be difficult to differentiate the marauders from the authentic soldier. Already, hundreds of villagers from the affected communities have fled the area and taking refuge in nearby towns. Terver Akase, Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the governor, who confirmed the incident, however said he could only confirm ten deaths. He said, “I can confirm that Fulani herdsmen last night and earlier today invaded Saghev ward of Guma Local Gvernment Area, Benue State and killed many innocent persons. “Ten corpses have so far (that is at the time of sending the statement) been recovered with many others injured. “The armed herdsmen also burnt numerous houses, shops and other property in the area.” While the attacks as “mindless and unprovoked”, Akase urged security agencies to arrest the herdsmen behind the killings for prosecution. The State Command of the Nigeria Police was yet to confirm the report as at the time of compiling this report. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Moses Yamu told Sunday INDEPENDENT that he was yet to get the report, with a promise to get back to us soon as he confirmed the incident. 0 comments
