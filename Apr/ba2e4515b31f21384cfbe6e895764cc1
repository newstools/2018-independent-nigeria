Lagos – Alloy Agu, the Super Eagles goalkeeper trainer, has pleaded with Nigerians not to writeoff the team based on their 2-0 loss to Serbia in their recent friendly games against Poland and Serbia. Ago who spoke to DAILY INDEPENDENT on Sunday, called on Nigerians to support the team, saying that if there were errors noticed in the matches played, then the encounters had served their purposes. The former national team goalkeeper, however, said that the technical crew under Coach Gernot Rohr was working round the clock to address all grey areas noticed in the matches, assuring that the Super Eagles would take shape before the start of the World Cup. “We should not run to judge the team so fast after the two matches we played against Poland and Serbia. They were just friendly matches and you can see that the coach interchanged players to test several options. “If you notice anything in those matches, then the matches had served their purpose. That is the essence of playing friendly matches. The coach is very busy going round to make sure that the team is in shape before the World Cup. “We are working round the clock to ensure that Nigerians see a team they will be proud of at the World Cup,” Agu said. Nigeria kick-start their World Cup campaign on June 16 against Croatia. Before the World Cup, Nigeria will play Congo DR, England and Czech Republic respectively in friendly matches. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
