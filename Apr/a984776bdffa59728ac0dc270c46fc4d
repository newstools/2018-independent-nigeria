It has been reported that French Ligue 1 side Monaco have not been successful in their attempt to sign KAA Gent winger Samuel Kalu. The Principality side, whose sporting director is former Nigeria international Michael Emenalo, backed out of the deal after they were quoted a fee of €15 million for the youngster. It was understood that Gent are willing to allow another Nigerian winger in Moses Simon depart the club this summer but they informed Monaco that Kalu was not for sale at the start of negotiations and they will demand an astronomical fee if they have a change of heart. Monaco’s first bid for Kalu was for a paltry €6 million, but that amount was deemed insufficient by the former Belgian First Division A champions. The 20-year-old is having an outstanding season, scoring 6 goals in 24 appearances during the regular season while registering seven assists. He was named among the top fifty most promising prospects in Europe by CIES Football Observatory, the only player of Nigerian descent that made the prestigious list. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
