According to him, “I call on my brothers and friends from the APC who have already been dumped and screened out for a preferred anointed candidate to join me let us build a new Nasarawa where everybody shall be treated equally. “If you are looking for democracy you can’t find it in APC. Those who are fighting for a ticket that will not be given to them are welcome in APGA where no preferred or anointed candidate exist”, says Maku.
