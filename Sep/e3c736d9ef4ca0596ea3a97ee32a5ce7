Yekini Nabena, the Acting National Publicity Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), said he has accepted Senate President Bukola Saraki’s challenge to debate national issues on any national television, according to an online newspaper. Saraki had in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity Yusuph Olaniyonu, said: “Mr Yekinni Nabena should know by now that many people on the media believe he is a robot and has no face. “Here is an opportunity for him to come out of his hiding and come on a national television to debate all the issues he has raised with one of the aides of the Senate President.” Responding to Saraki’s challenge through Newsguru, an online publication,  Nabena said the debate would be between the party and Saraki, not his aides. His words: “Is it his aides that will argue for him? What about himself? I am challenging him to come out and debate on national issues with the leadership of the APC. “He has declared for presidency. If he feels he knows what he will go and do there, he should come out and tell Nigerians. It’s not by bringing his aides. Are they the ones running for presidency? “APC is ready to take him up on any issue. He believes that he doesn’t have any issue apart from his personal and selfish interest,” he said Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
