Lagos – Nigeria’s sole remainder in the continental football, Enyimba International of Aba, have qualified in style for the 2018 CAF Confederation Cup semifinal after a comprehensive aggregate 5-1 win over the Rayon Sports of Rwanda in Aba on Sunday. The match, which took place at the refurbished Aba Township Stadium, saw the Peoples Elephants taking the lead as early as the 12th minute when Stanley Dimgba benefitted from poor defending by Rayon Sports defenders to shoot the Peoples Elephants ahead. But the excitement was short-lived as the visitors responded in the 25th minute through Bonfils Caleb Bimenyimana. Enyimba, however, surged forward for more goals knowing that with the score line remaining like that, they would be eliminated. Their efforts paid off four minutes later when left back, Ikouwem Utin, scored from a short-range effort. The first half ended thus, but in the second half, the Peoples Elephants continued from where they stopped in the first stanza. Three minutes into the restart, Enyimba consolidated as Dimgba set up Sunday Adetunji to tap in from close range for their third goal and the fourth of the match. But in the 60th minute, the former African champions netted their fourth of the evening. Joseph Osadiaye’s free kick took a slight deflection off Rayon’s wall and beat their goalkeeper, Abouba. Meanwhile, after the fourth goal, Enyimba showed relentlessness and continued to push forward for more goals and Isiaka Oladuntoye made it happen after he headed a spilled ball into the opponent’s net in the 78th minute. Dimgba played a free Kick, which was spilled by Abouba for Isiaka to head home. The former African champions will now take on Raja Casabianca of Morroco in the semifinal.
