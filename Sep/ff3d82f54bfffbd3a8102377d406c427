ABUJA – In spite of the directive of the FCT Minister, Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello that all dropped Mandate Secretaries of the FCT Administration and Special Assistants should hand over before close of work yesterday, Wednesday 26th September, 2018, all but one have failed to hand over. Investigation by our correspondent revealed that only Sen. Isa Maina of  the Education Secretariat handed over in an informal manner to the new Secretary, Dr. Bala Liman. When our correspondent visited the Transportation Secretariat, the Director of Admin and Finance, Mrs. Alice Odey Achu was said to have already taken charge and preparing a hand over note as the former Transportation Secretary, Comrade Kayode Opeifa was not available to do so. Similarly, Mohammed Mai Bornu, the Chief of Staff to the FCT Minister is to oversee the Transportation Secretariat, according to sources. In the Health and Human Services Secretariat, where Amanda Pam held sway there was no news of any hand over as she had not indicated any interest in doing so. She however, has vacated office and commenced politicking. The Minister had directed  Dr. Aminu Mohammadu Mai, General Manager of the FCT Hospital Services Management Board to take over from Pam in the Health and Human Services Secretariat. Isa Dara Bwari, S.A. community relations was expected to handover to Chika Nwatu, another SA on Community Relations to the FCT Minister. As at the time of filling this report, only Sen. Isa Maina had complied with the FCT Minister’s directive and handed over to his successor. SHOCKING STORY!!!
