Lagos – The bearish sentiment in the domestic bourse was sustained this week as investors continued to sell off on market bellwethers. The downtrend remains largely driven by the lingering uncertainties around the 2019 general elections which we expect to be sustained. The bourse recorded a total turnover of 892.725 million shares worth N13.075 billion in 15,607 deals traded last week by investors in contrast to a total of 1.533 billion shares valued at N23.026 billion that exchanged hands in the previous week in 17,009 deals. The Financial Services Industry led the activity chart with 757.992 million shares valued at N9.251 billion traded in 9,653 deals; thus contributing 84.91 per cent and 70.76 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively. The Consumer Goods Industry followed with 43.651 million shares worth N2.754 billion in 2,231 deals. The third place was occupied by Oil and Gas Industry with a turnover of 28.892 million shares worth N558.264 million in 1,430 deals. The benchmark index declined on four of five trading days in the week, with the largest loss recorded on Wednesday (-1.5%), while the only gain in the week was on Tuesday (+0.3%). On a week-on-week (W-o-W) basis, the All Share Index (ASI) fell 2.3 per cent to 34,037.91 points while YTD loss worsened to -11.0 per cent. Likewise, market capitalisation reduced N295.9 billion to settle at N12.4 trillion. In the same vein, activity level weakened as average volume and value contracted 41.7 per cent and 43.1 per cent to 178.5 million units and N2.6 billion respectively. The major drags to performance in the week were Nigerian Breweries (-5.1%), Dangote Cement (-2.2%) and Guaranty Trust Bank (-2.8%). The top traded stocks by value were Guaranty Trust Bank (N1.7bn), Access Bank (N429.8m) and Seplat Petroleum Development Company (N260.8m) while Guaranty Trust Bank (46.9m units), Access Bank (46.1m units) and AIICO Insurance (33.2m units) were the top traded by volume. Sector performance was also bearish as all indices closed in the red W-o-W. The Oil & Gas index depreciated the most, down 3.7 per cent W-o-W following losses in Seplat Petroleum Development Company (-7.2%) and Oando (-0.9%) while sustained sell offs in Nigerian Breweries (-5.1%) and Unilever Nigeria (-6.4%) dragged the consumer goods index 2.7 per cent southwards. Similarly, the Banking and Industrial Goods indices fell 2.4 per cent and 1.9 per cent following price depreciation in Guaranty Trust Bank (-2.8%) and Dangote Cement (-2.2%) respectively. The Insurance index closed out the negative performance with a 0.1 per cent decline W-o-W. Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
