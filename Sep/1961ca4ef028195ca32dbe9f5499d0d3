Lagos – Nigeria’s sole campaigner in CAF competition, Enyimba of Aba, will arrive Kigali, Rwanda, today for the first leg CAF Confederation Cup quarter final against the Rayon Sports, on Sunday, September 17. This is according to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), who said that the two-time African champions will land at Kigali International Airport at 9PM aboard a RwandAir flight from Lagos. The eight-time Rwandan champions secured slot to quarter-finals of the continent’s second biggest club competition last month after finishing second, with nine points, in Group B. Out of six games played in the four-team group; Rayon won two, drew three, and lost one. The Blues stormed the round of last eight alongside Algerian giants USM Alger who topped Group B with 11 points. Kenyan champions Gor Mahia (8 points) and Tanzania’s Young Africans (4 points) were the other two group members. They bowed out. Enyimba, who are competing in the Confederation Cup for a second time following the 2010 debut, are on the hunt to end their continental jinx as they bid for a first title in CAF competitions since their 2004 CAF Champions League triumph. Enyimba topped Group C with 12 points, ahead of the Republic of Congo’s CARA Brazzaville with 9 points. Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
