Abubakar Malami, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, has intervened in a suit filed by some senators loyal to Bukola Saraki preempting plans to forcefully remove him from office as Senate President. Malami is questioning the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court, Abuja, presided over by Justice Nnamdi Dimgba, to hear the case. The AGF, through his lawyer, Abdullahi Abubakar, told Justice Dimgba on Thursday that there was an application challenging the jurisdiction of the court on the matter. The suit pending at the court was filed on August 27 by Senators Isa Misau and Rafiu Adebayo, seeking the court’s ruling to prevent the forceful removal of Saraki after he defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Insistent calls for Saraki’s resignation from high quarters in the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) coupled with rumours of anti-Saraki plots had ignited fears among his loyalists of a likely forceful removal. Analysts claim that the APC only has a slight majority in the 109-member Senate whereas two-third majority is required to remove a Senate President. But loyalists of the Senate President maintain that the APC may not follow parliamentary procedure to remove him. The application has 11 respondents including the Attorney-General of the Federation. Other respondents in the suit include the Senate, the Senate President, his Deputy, the Senate Leader, his Deputy, and the Minority Leader. Others are the Clerk of the Senate, the Deputy Senate Clerk, Inspector General of Police and the Department of State Services. But Justice Dimgba ruled on Thursday that he would attend to the AGF’s application together with other applications on the next adjourned date of September 19.
