Prospective players for the forthcoming 2018 Awa Ibrahim Junior Golf Open Championship have been advised to commence registration on or before October 19, 2018. The championship, the fifth edition, which will hold at the Ikeja Golf Club, Lagos from October 25-27 is targeted at teenagers from 17 years and under. Emy Ekong, Director of Youth and Women Development, Nigeria Golf Federation (NGF) said, “The earlier the children (players) register, the better because it will help the (Local) Organising committee to put all the logistics in place at the right time.” 24 exceptional kid-golfers were rewarded with scholarship worth N1.4 million at the final of the 2017 edition of the championship. Alhaji Awa Ibrahim, the sponsor has promised additional N50,000 for the first prize winners – N200, 000 – in the subsequent edition to encourage the competition among the players. A breakdown of the cash prize in 2017 had first position winners in the four categories pocketing N200, 000 each; second positions earned N100, 000 each and third positions got N50, 000 each. The scholarship is for two academic years even as the sponsor affirmed, “The money will be paid directly into the account of the schools of the winners; we will not give individuals cash.” He also said, “We are more interested in the education of the children and that is the reason we are encouraging that they should not abandoned their school for golf; it should be combined.” Georgia Oboh, a United States (US)/United Kingdom (UK) based golfer is the defending champion.
