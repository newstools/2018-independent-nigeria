LAGOS – Hon. Moshood Salvador, former chairman of Peoples Democratic party (PDP), Lagos State chapter, was on Saturday received by the All Progressives Congress (APC), an event that was witnessed by thousands of party supporter. Salvador, who was impressed by the huge crowd the thronged the Agege Stadium, venue of his official declaration, stated that the 2019 general elections would be remarkable for APC as Lagos had become a one-party state. Salvador said he did not join APC to joke, but to let the leadership understand that they now have a member who would better the lot of the party. The supporters, all adorned in colourful Ankara material, who defected with Salvador, suggested that he had made good his promise to move with about 60 percent of PDP members, who he had personally endeared to the former party through his visionary leadership style. He said: “Lagos is now a one-party state because when you have a combination of APC and PDP votes, you will have 98 percent of the votes. Now that the votes of PDP had been joined to that of APC, Lagos State will be all APC affair. All the other parties put together are insignificant. “My assignment is to get 98 percent of the votes for APC, 2.5 million votes for governorship and five million for presidential elections. “We will work towards that because that will be my contribution to support the chairman of the party, Hon Tunde Balogun.” Balogun, while receiving Salvador, said that a new chapter had been opened in the history of APC in Lagos State, even as he commended the former PDP helmsman and his supporters for joining his party.
