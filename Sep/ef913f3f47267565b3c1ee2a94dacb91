Ugandan independent MP Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, who was allegedly tortured and detained by security agencies and later charged with treason has narrated his ordeal. In posts on his social media platforms, the Kyadondo East MP —who is currently undergoing specialised treatment in the US — says he decided to give his account after reading reactions posted by President Yoweri Museveni and other government officials on social media sites. Mr Kyagulanyi, Mityana Municipality MP Francis Zaake, Arua Municipality MP Kassiano Wadri, and other political activists, were embroiled in a spat with security agents on the last day of by-election campaigns for the Arua Municipality seat last month. Thirty-three people, including Mr Kyagulanyi and Mr Wadri, have since been charged with treason following allegations of stoning the President’s motorcade in the Arua fracas. President Museveni had gone to canvass voters for his National Resistance Movement party candidate, Ms Nusura Tiperu. “They wrapped me in a thick piece of cloth and bundled me into a vehicle.
