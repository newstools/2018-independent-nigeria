Lagos – Nigeria’s and Leganes of Spain defender, Kenneth Omeruo has given thumbs up to his teammates for beating FC Barcelona on Wednesday night, as he believes it was a sign that his side would get better in the season. Omeruo could only watch from the sidelines, as his trip back home to Nigeria to sort out personal matters knocked him out of the match, but he is happy the team coped in his absence. The win is the biggest in the history of Leganes, and the first for Pellegrino since taking charge of the team. It is the second defeat for Barcelona in their last 51 La Liga games. However, Omeruo was left out by Leganes manager, Mauricio Pellegrino after failing to return to Spain on time from Nigeria where he had gone to attend to personal matters. Since joining the bottom placed club from Chelsea on loan this season, Omeruo has not played a single match for Leganes after five rounds of matches. The stopper said that he would battle in training to gain a shirt for this weekend’s fixture in La Liga. Before then, though, the Super Eagles star will relish memories of how his pals at Leganes tore up all bookmakers’ forecasts to secure a historic win, after coming from behind to defeat the Spanish league leaders on Wednesday night. Although Leganes were placed last on La Liga’s table heading into the game, they pulled off a shock 2-1 win against the champions, such that Omeruo was left enchanted in the stands. Philippe Coutinho scored for Barca in the 12th minute with Nabil El Zhar getting the equaliser for the home side in the 52nd and the winning goal a minute later through Oscar, in a game that had six yellow cards from centre referee Alberto Undiano Mallenco.
