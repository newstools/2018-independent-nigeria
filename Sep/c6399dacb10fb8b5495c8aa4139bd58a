AWKA – It was a grand occasion and epoch-making at the Orumba-North local government hall Ajali as Ifeyinwa Obinabo took over the mantle of leadership from her predecessor thereby becoming the first female council chairman of the area. Presenting her acceptance speech, Obinabo said it has been her burning desire to serve her people in such capacity, especially as it concerns grassroots development. Although she noted that the job of a local government chairman required humility , dedication and other character traits necessary for the smooth running of the local government , she pledged her avowed commitment to duty and to touch lives in the course of her stewardship . She said Orumba- North was one of the most dynamic local government areas in Anambra State especially with its richness in agriculture and other solid minerals; noting that with the cooperation and support of the people, Orumba-North would take the lead in the state. Emeka Aforka who handed over the administration of the local government to his successor, said his administration initiated and completed life-touching and people-oriented projects in Orumba-North which according to him were funded with the little resources available. Aforka therefore urged the in-coming chairman to consolidate on the projects and do more projects as well as inspect all projects for quality control and for the betterment of the people of Orumba-North local government area. The chairman emeritus also commended some committees duly set up to assist in piloting the affairs of the local government while urging his successor to be wary of detractors and distractions that could be detrimental to her administration.
