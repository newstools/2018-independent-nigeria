MultiChoice has released the list of 20 students selected as the first intake of the MultiChoice Talent Factory Academy. The candidates were chosen after a two-month long process of short listing candidates from over 3,000 entries from Nigeria and Ghana. This was followed by a rigorous interview and adjudication process by a group of film and television industry experts, and MultiChoice regional Academy Director, Femi Odugbemi. MultiChoice will sponsor the students’ tuition, accommodation and stipend for the duration of their training in the academy. “As a company that is deeply rooted in Nigeria, we understand that many young, aspiring filmmakers have the capacity to learn and strengthen their skill set to give back to their communities but may not be financially equipped to do so. The MultiChoice Talent Factory focuses on making sure that those gems are nurtured, and their talents developed to contribute meaningfully to Africa’s creative industry,” said John Ugbe, Managing Director. The MTF Academy students will be provided with skill sets to develop their talent, connect with industry professionals and tell authentic African stories through a comprehensive curriculum comprising theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience in cinematography, editing, audio production and storytelling.
