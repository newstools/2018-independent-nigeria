Lagos – The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has disowned a recruitment advertisement currently trending in the social media. The advertisement, set in NNPC’s corporate colour with its logo and a corporate picture, invites candidates with background in Sciences, Engineering, Business/Finance, Social Sciences, Arts/Humanities as well as Medical/Health Sciences, to apply, this time, without stating any required educational attainments of prospects, unlike in the past wherein the scam advert had listed the following as requirements for qualification: Master’s degree, Bachelor’s degree, Higher National Diploma (HND) and National Diploma. A release by the NNPC Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, described the advertisement as phoney, advising unsuspecting members of the public to be wary of the scam. The corporation said the recruitment announcement or invitation to recruitment interview of this nature appearing intermittently in the social media should be discountenanced, as NNPC was not carrying out any recruitment exercise now. The National Oil Company dissociated itself from the fake e-mail address to which unsuspecting prospects were asked to direct their Curriculum Vitae in the placement advert. NNPC reminded job seekers to note the antics of scammers who deploy, on social media platforms, such communication strategies as text messages, vacancy announcements and forged letters inviting them for non-existing job interviews, saying they are tricks to extort money from them. NNPC cautioned that any applicant who entertained such invitations would have himself or herself to blame, encouraging those who had already fallen victims to volunteer information to the law enforcement agencies.
