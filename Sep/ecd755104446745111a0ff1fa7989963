Victor Otuya and Wilson Macaulay WARRI – The Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) has said it is putting mechanisms in place for an international campaign against the present administration to prevent the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari come 2019 election. The IYC also restated its stand that people of the Niger Delta would not give their votes to any presidential candidate, particularly those of the All Progressive Congress (APC), if there were no concrete agreements on the country’s restructuring. Comrade Oweilaemi Pereotubo, IYC President, who spoke to SUNDAY INDEPENDENT, said the body would embark on a global campaign to tell the world how President Buhari failed the Nigerian people. Pereotubo said: “I pray that Mr. President will get some things right before we meet. But, one thing is very important here. Whatever we are doing is within the ambit of the law. “Whether we are going to protest or demonstrate, we demonstrate peacefully. We are putting mechanisms in place to take our demonstrations outside this shores and tell the world that President Muhammadu Buhari has failed the Nigerian people.” Oweileami also stressed that restructuring would develop the country and ensure improved security, adding, “We urge Mr. President to start the processes of restructuring this country because the in-thing in Nigeria today is restructuring. “Restructuring is a national call for Mr. President if he means well and he doesn’t want to put Nigeria in flames. Mr. President should immediately kick-start the processes of restructuring this country.” Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
