Former Governor of Abia State and Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr. Orji Kalu, has described the victory of Mr. Gboyega Oyetola of the APC in the keenly contested governorship election in Osun State as a re-affirmation of the popularity of the party across Nigeria. Kalu while lauding stakeholders of the party for their unrelenting efforts before, during and after the poll, stressed that the APC is the only party with the interests of Nigerians at heart. In a goodwill message signed by his Special Adviser, Kunle Oyewumi, Kalu applauded the people of Osun state for their peaceful conduct during the election. He said, “with the victory of the APC in Osun state governorship election, it is crystal clear that the party remains unbeatable across the country. “Just recently, the party won the governorship seat in Ekiti State. This is another feat for our great party. The APC has been growing from strength to strength and by leaps and bounds despite the propaganda being peddled by political jobbers. In 2019, it will be victory all the way. “I salute all the candidates especially Senators Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Iyiola Omisore of the Social democratic Party (SDP) for their level of maturity during the election.” The former governor advised Oyetola to run an all-inclusive government, adding that the collective interest of the people of the state should be placed above selfish ambitions, noting that regardless of party affiliation, indigenes and residents of Osun State must benefit from good governance.
