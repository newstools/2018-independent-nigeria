The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has commenced preliminary preparation for the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Libya in Kaduna. The match will hold at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium Kaduna on October 10. Nigeria, who place third in the group that includes South Africa, rekindled their hope of qualifying for the tournament following their 3-0 defeat of Seychelles last Saturday. Nigeria had lost 2-0 to South Africa in their first qualifying game in Uyo. Qualifying for the tournament is dependent on winning in Kaduna and at least pull an away draw against Libya in their reverse fixture. To ensure that Super Eagles win the Kaduna tie, the NFF has commenced discussions with Kaduna state government with the view towards having hitch free match. An NFF source confirmed on Thgursday that the federation was already in talks with the state over the match. The NFF also denied that Coach Gernot Rohr was against the choice of Kaduna for the match. Rohr is believed to have said, “There is no issue about the venue for our match against Libya because we have decided to play at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium Kaduna.” “We have informed CAF that the venue of the match with Libya will be Kaduna and we are not going back on that. “Whatever flaws observed during the inspection of the stadium will be put in place before the end of the month.” Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
