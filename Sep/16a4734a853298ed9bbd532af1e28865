Iran’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations sent a letter to the UN Security Council and Secretary-General urging them to condemn Israeli threats. Furthermore Tehran supervised its nuclear programme, local media reported on Thursday. Speaking at the renaming ceremony of the Negev Nuclear Research Centre in the Israeli city of Dimona in late August, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that “whoever threatens us with our demise puts himself in similar danger’’. Iran perceived Netanyahu’s words as “a serious threat to international security and peace’’ and called on the international community to take a strong stand against this statement. Tehran urged the United Nations to make Israel sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and place the Israeli nuclear programme under supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Tasnim news agency reported. Netanyahu said in late April that Israel had obtained “secret files’’ which as he said proved that Iran ran a secret programme to build nuclear weapons. Tehran responded by calling Netanyahu an “infamous liar’’. Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
