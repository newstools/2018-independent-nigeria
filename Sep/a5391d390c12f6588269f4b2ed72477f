Lagos – Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr has ruled out Ahmadu Bello Stadium in Kaduna for  the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier against Libya next month because it is “too small”. Rohr has already visited the ABS with top officials, but said the pitch at the stadium is not big enough for his wingers to run at the Libyan defenders. Nigeria welcomes Group E leaders, Libya on October 10 with the reverse fixture three days later. And the Super Eagles coach has demanded for a big pitch to allow his team express themselves fully against the North Africans. “We are still looking out for a venue for the qualifier before communicating with the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF). “We need to come out with the choice of the venue before the end of next week for the qualifier”, said our source at the NFF. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that the team has the Uyo International Stadium their home, but the pitch may now not be available for this AFCON qualifier. The new Stephen Keshi Memorial Stadium in Asaba has also been mentioned to stage this match.
