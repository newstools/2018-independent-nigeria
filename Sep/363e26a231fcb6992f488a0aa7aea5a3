There was confusion at the Oja-Oba, Ibadan, customary court Friday as an Arabic teacher, Malam Bashiru Yekini engaged one Mr. Oluwasegun Olalekan in verbal altercation over the rightful husband of a woman simply identified as Mariam. Malam Yekini had filed a suit seeking the dissolution of his marriage to Mariam and custody of the only child in the marriage. Yekini stated in the suit that he paid the bride price on Mariam to her family in 2014 of which she bore him a child named Abdulganiyu Yekini. But the respondent in the suit Olalekan said Yekini was merely the woman’s spiritual father and not her husband more so she does not have any baby for him as he claimed. The woman also openly declared that she is legally married to Mr Olalekan. Olalekan buttressed that claim, saying he was the man Mariam’s parents recognised as her husband and she already had two children for him. He gave the name of his first child as Victoria and the second as Olamide. The president of the court, Chief Odunade Ademola, adjourned the case till October, 2018 for further hearing. He ordered the plaintiff, as well as the first and second defendants to invite their parents and the children to court on the next adjournment for more clarification.
