The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has approved a request by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to have the Africa Cup of Nations first leg qualifier against Libya shifted to a new date and venue. Information gathered reveals that the confirmation from CAF came in a formal notification to Libyan Football Federation (LFF) that the first leg of their double-qualifier against Nigeria would now hold at Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo, on Saturday, October 13. The notification from CAF to LFF in effect confirms that the match will no longer hold at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium, Kaduna on October 12, while the reverse fixture in the Group E tussle between both countries will now be on October 16 in Tunisia. This is a major victory for Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, who has expressed concerns about the size of the Ahmadu Bello Stadium pitch. Rohr buttressed his worries when he met top shots of the NFF during The Best FIFA Football Awards 2018 in London on September 24. Incidentally, while the Franco-German feared that the ABS pitch was not up to standard and his players would not be comfortable playing on the turf, NFF top shots had already expressed worries about possible overcrowding by fans at the stadium in Kaduna. It would be recalled that CAF slammed Nigeria with a $5,000 fine for allowing excess spectators at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium for an AFCON qualifier against Egypt in March 2016. SHOCKING STORY!!!
