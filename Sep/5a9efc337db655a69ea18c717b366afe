The Police Command in Bayelsa has said it had restored normalcy to Brass Island, after violence erupted in the area, from a clash between two cult groups earlier in the day. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP. Asinim Butswat, stated this in an interview in Yenagoa. “The report we have from Brass Island is that of a clash between rival cult groups and we deployed personnel to restore peace to the area. “The PDP secretariat in Brass was not attacked, we have restored peace in the area,” Butswat said. Earlier, Mr. Victor Isaiah, Caretaker Chairman, Brass Local Government Area, had told journalists that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) secretariat in the area was attacked by some thugs. Isaiah alleged that the thugs were loyal to the All Progressives Congress (APC). He called on the Inspector-General of Police to investigate the violence in the island and bring the perpetrators to book. Isaiah, in company of Sen. Ben Murray-Bruce (PDP-Bayelsa East), said that PDP supporters in Brass were in dire need of protection, following the proposed visit of APC chieftain, Timipre Sylva at the weekend. Murray-Bruce said that he would raise the matter on the floor of the Senate when the National Assembly reconvened. SHOCKING STORY!!!
