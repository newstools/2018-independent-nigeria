A communist candidate in Russia’s Far East on Monday alleged the gubernatorial election was rigged so that the pro-Kremlin incumbent would win. The Communist Party candidate, Andrei Ishchenko, announced that he was going on hunger strike and called for his supporters to take to the streets. The Communist Party is the country’s second-strongest political party behind the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, endorsed by President Vladimir Putin. In a run-off for governor of Russia’s far-eastern Primorye region, Ishchenko was narrowly winning versus the incumbent, Andrei Tarasenko, on Sunday when 95 per cent of the votes had been counted. However, Ishchenko appeared to lose overnight.
He claimed in a video posted on Facebook that voting results in several areas, including in the regional capital, Vladivostok, were falsified. The federal electoral authority said it was investigating and called for Ishchenko to refrain from starving himself. “We have the situation under control,’’ the Central Election Commission’s head, Ella Pamfilova, said in a statement. She, however, urged local officials not to conclude the results until the whole picture is completely presented. Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
