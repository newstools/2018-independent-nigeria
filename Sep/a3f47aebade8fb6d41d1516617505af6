ASABA – All Progressive Congress (APC), Delta State has described the claim that over 5,000 of its members in Delta Central defected to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as a film trick and ridiculous. PDP had claimed over 5,000 members of APC defected to the party during its mega rally in Ughelli some weeks ago, signaling the end of APC in the state. Prophet Jones Erue, Chairman of APC in the state told Sunday INDEPENDENT in Asaba during the screening of aspirants vying for House of Representatives seat that the figure of the unknown members who defected in Ughelli from the APC to the PDP were fabricated to make it look like PDP is in charge. “I am laughing at Okowa, 5,000 did not decamp. It is all a film trick, it is juggling of figures and that is very ridiculous. We want to takeover power and for sure, I am leading opposition to victory and we are wining the governorship election ilandslide victory,” he boasted.
