LOKOJA – Centre for Human Rights and Conflict Resolution (CHRCR), a Civil Society Organisation, has lambasted the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over its declaration of Osun State gubernatorial poll inconclusive, contrary to its earlier stand on the recently conducted Lokoja/Kogi Federal Constituency bye election. The CHRCR and the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Kogi State chapter, took INEC to the cleaners on Monday in Lokoja, the state capital, at a one-day workshop on the role of the media and the CSOs on anti-corruption, transparency and accountability in election. The workshop was organised by CHRCR, in partnership with Yar’Adua Foundation, with the support of MacArthur Foundation. In a communiqué jointly signed by the Executive Director of CHRCR, Idris Miliki Abdul, and  Adeiza Momoh jimoh, the Kogi NUJ chairman, noted that it  is worrisome that INEC, which looked the other way when infractions were recorded during the Lokoja/Koto Federal Constituency bye election held on August 11, 2018, would turn around to use sledge hammer on the Osun State gubernatorial election, held over the weekend. The participants urged INEC to tell the people the whole truth behind its selective judgement in declaring an election inconclusive while restating the  need for the  media practitioners to see itself  as part of the Civil Society Organisation in the country. According to the communiqué, the non-conduct of local government council election in Kogi for upward of three years has negated the principle of accountability and Democracy. SHOCKING STORY!!!
