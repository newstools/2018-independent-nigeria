Udinese of Italy defender, William Troost-Ekong wants to see Super Eagles captain, John Mikel Obi joins him in the Serie A. Troost-Ekong thinks that Mikel could still make a huge impression in Italy’s top-flight league. He believes Mikel’s world of experience and quality could come in handy for any top club in Italy, as he sees the Tianjin Teda of China midfielder as a role model. Incidentally, Mikel had been linked with Inter Milan, AC Milan and Juventus before he joined Teda from Chelsea in January 2017, but Troost-Ekong believes a switch could still happen. While rooting for Mikel to play in Italy, Troost-Ekong also rated his fellow-Eagles defender, Ola Aina of AS Torino as a player capable of enacting sterling marks in the Serie A. Aina is currently on a season-long loan deal from Chelsea at Torino , and Troost-Ekong believes the full back will make a success of the deal. Troost-Ekong said: ”I really like Ola Aina, who has moved from Chelsea to Torino. He is an excellent fullback and has all the qualities to do well in Serie A. “Who I would want to see in the Italian championship is John Obi Mikel. He is a great player and I think he could play in all the teams of Serie A and would make Italian football fans happy with his qualities.” Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
