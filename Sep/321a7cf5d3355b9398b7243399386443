LAGOS – As jostlings for the 2019 general elections gather momentum, Chief Martins Onovo, the 2015 presidential candidate of the National Conscience Party (NCP) and a 2019 presidential aspirant, has quit the party. Onovo, in a letter dated September 4, 2018, titled ‘Resignation of Membership’ obtained bySunday INDEPENDENT, said he was quitting the party because its management  had abandoned the principles and values and betrayed the legacy of the founder, late Chief (Dr.) Gani Fawehinmi (SAN), which the members hold very dear. He said; “With the vicious violations of the provisions of the party constitution, financial irregularities, abuse of power, division of the NEC and sponsored factions in very many states, I can no longer tolerate the hypocrisy and perfidy presently prevailing which has led many great patriots to leave the party silently. “We must fight corruption in government and elsewhere, including in political parties. “I restate my commitment to the universal values of Integrity, Rule of law, Justice Service and Excellence on which the party was founded.” He lamented in the letter addressed to Comrade Ayodele Akele, the party’s National Secretary that the party’s current management had deviated from this ideal, hence he must dissociate himself from what he termed a perfidy. Onovo stated: “I thank immensely all the patriotic members of the party for their great confidence in me and I assure them that we remain committed to our values and our patriotic objectives.
