Ughelli – Polobubo (Tsekelewu) Community of Egbema Kingdom in Warri North Local Government Area of Delta State was at the weekend ravaged by flood, destroying several properties worth millions of naira. It was learnt that the flood also ravaged and submerged Bemogri, Azagbene, Lagos, Zion, Pinakri sub-communities, two Secondary Schools, three Primary Schools, town hall and over 150 houses with several farms and fishing ponds affected. Comrade Markson Aboh, General Secretary, Polobubo(Tsekelewu) Youth Executive and Honourable Dickson Asoki who spoke on behalf of the community, stated that they have written letters to the presidency requesting for a new Polobubo(Tsekelewu) to be reclaim for them because their present location is no longer suitable for living. According to them, “the presidency has given approval and we want that job to commence immediately so that the situation can be moderated. We want to move to a higher ground and without that reclamation it cannot be done because the situation will repeat itself next year”. They noted that the ravaging flood started ten years ago when Chevron Nigeria Limited dug a channel linking the Atlantic Ocean which resulted to salt water and silt deposits flowing in and destroying fishes, animals, trees and other creatures that can only survive in fresh water. While suggesting for the opened channel to be block to stop further inflow of silt deposits and salt water, the community leaders appealed for relief materials to assuage the sufferings of members of the community.
