Members of alumni of Community Grammar School, Akowonjo set of 2001 is set to hold a world-class reunion on Sunday, September 23. Having held series of meetings and planning sessions for what the old students believe is overdue, the committee has finally come together to bring their plans to fruition. Speaking on the purpose of the event, Sheriff Olajide Ahmed, president of the association, explained that it had been a long time that the event was to hold, however, the busy schedules of members of the alumni made such event almost impossible to pull off. However, based on the need to both reconnect with old friends and still make an impact at their alma mater, they have decided to selflessly come together to celebrate their achievements as a class, and as old students of the school. This is to ensure that they become a part of the growth process of the school that nurtured them. Being the first of its kind for them, plans are underway to make it a memorable, yet befitting experience for all involved. In addition, it is to make their marks as worthy graduates of the citadel of learning, Community Grammar School, Akowonjo. Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
