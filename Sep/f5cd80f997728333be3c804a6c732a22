The Nigeria Basketball Federation has announced October 2, 2018 as the new date for the Final 8 of the 2018 Total NBBF Division 2 League. The decision was taken by the federation during its last board meeting held in Lagos during the last window of the FIBA World Cup qualifiers. Despite the earlier fixed date of September 16-22 for the games holding in Lagos, the NBBF agreed that since this was the inaugural edition, there was the need to give it the necessary attention needed. “We just finished the FIBA World Cup qualifiers and many people are still talking about it. Come Saturday, the D’Tigress will start their World Cup campaign in Tenerife, Spain and all attention will be on them too”, NBBF President,  Musa Kida said. “So, we thought holding the Total NBBF Division 2 finals in between these two global events will in no small way drown the necessary attention that should be given to it.” He said that the federation would leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the players were the focal point of the federation’s attention. “The players are our clients. Nigerians have seen what we have achieved with the men and women’s senior national teams and the hosting of the FIBA World Cup qualifiers which has been unprecedented in the history of Nigerian basketball. It’s time to replicate this at the local scene.” Nigeria Prisons Reformers (Niger) will play Nassarawa Golden Touch, Taraba Hurricanes, Bukavu Blinks (Kano), CAMAC (Bayelsa), Coal City (Enugu), Ondo Kings (Akure) and Brave Hearts for the Division 2 title.
