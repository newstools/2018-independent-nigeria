Lagos – Tomorrow’s governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State will be a straight fight between Governor Akinwunmi Ambode and Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, INDEPENDENT has gathered. A credible source in the Justice Forum, an influential political group in the state said the third aspirant, Dr. Kadri Obafemi Hamzat, will step down for Sanwo-Olu today. The reconciliatory efforts being made by the campaign team of Sanwo-Olu to woo aggrieved members of the APC seems to be paying off.
