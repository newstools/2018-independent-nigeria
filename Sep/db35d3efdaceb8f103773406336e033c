Lagos – Golden Eaglets chief coach, Manu Garba, has warned the players not to be carried away with their friendly successes ahead of next year’s Africa Under-17 Cup of Nations. Rather, he advised them to enact their form at zonal qualifiers in Niamey, Niger Republic, which commences today. He charged the players not to rest on their oars, as they prepare for their first match against Burkina Faso on Monday. In their build-up programme, the Golden Eaglets played 26 friendly matches and scored over 100 goals, while conceding only 16, an average of 0.62 goals per game, winning 25 of their friendly matches and drawing only one. Eaglets defeated Ituen Academy 3-1 in their final game on Tuesday, August 28 before their trip to Niamey on Friday. Manu however insisted it would not be about figures on paper any longer when they line out against Burkina Faso at Stade Municipal, Niamey on September 3. Cote d’Ivoire and Benin Republic are Nigeria’s other opponents in Group B and Manu said he is fully aware of the hurdles his side will face, as only the winning team from the zonal qualifiers will qualify for the U17 AFCON billed for Tanzania in May next year.
