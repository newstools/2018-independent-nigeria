Abuja – The Police Service Commission (PSC) said it has rated the conduct of police officers on election duties at Saturday, September 22, 2018 governorship election in Osun State as largely satisfactory. The commission, in a statement by its spokesman, Ikechukwu Ani, said it monitored the conduct of police officers in the 30 local government areas of the state. “Reports from the commission’s monitors indicate that outside few isolated incidents, the conduct of the police was impressive. The few isolated incidents included cases where the police officers were overwhelmed and ballot boxes snatched, inducements and inability to stop discreet vote buying,” it stated. According to Ani, the commission also commended the mobilisation and deployment of police officers and the maintenance of peace and order at the polling units. The commission noted that, “police officers were also polite, approachable and largely adhered to the guidelines for election duties. There was an average of four police officers per polling unit, complemented by men of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps; Nigerian Immigrations Service, Nigerian Customs Service, Nigerian Prison Services, Federal Road Safety Corps and Department of State Security. Ani disclosed that the commission carried out the assignment in partnership with CLEEN Foundation and Policy and Legal Advocacy Centre, PLAC. SHOCKING STORY!!!
