Lagos – The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has been urged to commence investigation on the allegations of missing and unremitted funds from public accounts following the 2016 audit of the accounts of some Federal Government’s ministries and agencies by audit firm, Price WaterHouse Cooper. The Civil Society Network Against Corruption (CSNAC), which is a coalition of over 150 anti-corruption organizations, made the call in a petition it forwarded to the anti-graft commission and signed by the chairman of the Network, Olanrewaju Suraju. CSNAC said its petition was based on the report by Sahara Reporters dated August 27, 2018 where the online newspaper highlighted some of the auditor’s discoveries following a scrutiny of the 2016 audit report. According to report, some of the said revelations include the discovery that N50 million loan was written off the books of National Poverty Eradication Programme (NAPEP), Federal Ministry of Agriculture and to some Federal Government staff, without proper disclosure in the financial statement. Similarly, the report indicates that some collecting agencies in NNPC and DPR did not remit any revenue into the Federation Revenue Account for some months, neither was any explanation given why those months recorded no revenue. CSNAC said that it is worth noting that going by the provisions of Section 85 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, all public account must be audited mandatorily. Public account includes both the federation account and accounts of all government parastatals. The anti-graft coalition gave details of the said misappropriation and irregularities as follows: “N4 trillion unremitted revenue: A whooping sum of N4 trillion was, as of the time of preparing the report, unremitted to the Federation Account by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). “The total revenue unremitted as at 1st January 2016 from amounts payable into the Federation Account by NNPC was N3,878,955,039,855.73. The sum of N2,198,138,355,860.30 was due in revenue to the Federation Account out of the total generated in 2016, however, NNPC paid the sum of N1,000,545,058,966.2 resulting in an amount withheld of N197,593,296,894.02. This brought the total amount withheld by NNPC from the Federation Account as at 31 December 2016 to N4, 076,548,336,749.75.” It submitted that this act of under-remitting to the central account has been a year-on-year occurrence, according to the auditor.
