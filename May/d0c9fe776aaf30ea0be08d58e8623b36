If Real Madrid fans are worried about Cristiano Ronaldo’s fitness ahead of the Champions League final, then they shouldn’t be, according to Sport360.com. Ronaldo was forced off at half-time during last weekend’s 2-2 draw with Barcelona with an ankle sprain, sending supporters and the team into somewhat of a meltdown. However, the injury seems to be minor, and in fact the club now say their striker will come into the May 26 final against Liverpool in better condition than any of the previous European finals, including last year, when he was in top form and well-rested when he travelled to Cardiff. Ronaldo will miss Saturday’s match against Celta Vigo, but is scheduled to return next week against Villarreal in the final La Liga game of the season in order to get some playing time ahead of the final. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
