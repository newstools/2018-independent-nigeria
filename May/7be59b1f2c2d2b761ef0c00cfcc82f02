The non-arrival of video exhibit slated as an evidence against election of Gov.Willie Obiano of Anambra State in 2017, stalled proceedings on Friday at the Election Tribunal sitting in Awka. The petitioner, Ms Praise Okechukwu and candidate of the Mega Progressive Peoples’ Party (MPPP), was seeking the nullification of the election of Obiano as the state governor. Nkem Ekweozoh, Counsel to Okechukwu told the tribunal that those bringing the video evidence were involved in a road accident. Ekweozoh, who had a newspaper publication which was admitted as exhibit by the tribunal, pleaded that the matter be adjourned to enable him take delivery of the material and tender it. Onyechi Ikpeazu (SAN), Counsel to Obiano did not object to the plea. Justice H. A. Olusiyi, Chairman of the tribunal said the petitioner had not demonstrated enough seriousness on the matter and not mindful of the limited life span of the case. He however, granted the prayer and adjourned the matter for Monday, May 7. In a related matter, Mr Emeka Agbapuonwu, Counsel to Dr Paul Obianaso of Africa Democratic Congress (ADC), told the court that he was no longer interested in handling the matter and should be excused. Obianaso is also challenging Obiano’s election. Agbapuonwu said this through Onyema Udenyi esq. who appeared on his behalf due to ill health. 0 comments
