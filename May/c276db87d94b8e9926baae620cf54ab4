The outbreak and continued spread of fall armyworm in Kenya is threatening food security, Mwangi Kiunjuri, Cabinet Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, said on Wednesday. Kiunjuri said the occurrence of the pest particularly in the Rift Valley region in northwest Kenya, the country’s grain basket and seed maize producing areas, worsens the situation. “We are forced to build partnerships with all stakeholders to help us reduce the spread of the pest,” Kiunjuri said during a stakeholders meeting on fall armyworm in Nairobi. He attributed the emergence of pests and diseases such as fall armyworm changing climatic conditions, adding that between April and May 2017, 250,000 hectares of maize crop worth 31.5 million dollars was affected by the pest. Kiunjuri noted that since the agriculture sector is the largest contributor to national economic growth, directly contributing about 31.5 per cent to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), the sectors performance must be looked into keenly. Fall armyworm is a migratory pest native to the Americas, and was reported on the African continent in September 2016 in the West Africa region. It has since spread to almost all the sub-Saharan countries where it is causing severe damage, especially in maize fields and to more than 80 plant species. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
