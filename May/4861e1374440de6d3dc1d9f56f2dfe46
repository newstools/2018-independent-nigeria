Senator Shehu Sanni and supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari clashed on Twitter over a post by the lawmakers accusing “Buharists’ of only supporting the president because he is in power. His tweet read: “They never called themselves Buharists when Buhari was not in power. They will never call themselves Buharists when Buhari is out of power. They are Buharists because Buhari is in power. Temporary friends of the king, permanent friends of the throne.” Many of those who responded to the senator’s post lambasted him, saying they have no regret supporting Buhari. One of them,  Omorogbe Osas Earl @EarlOsas, said: “Buhari is not our father, not our relative but we are Buharist because we believe and trust in his integrity which has no mate as far as Nigeria is concerned. We are Buharist because we are supporting him and after his 8years we will cease to be buharist .” “You never hated Buhari until he distances himself from you. Until he refuses to join you in fighting El- rufai . Opportunistic Friend of the king, permanent friend of personal interest,” @DeeOneAyekooto replied. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
