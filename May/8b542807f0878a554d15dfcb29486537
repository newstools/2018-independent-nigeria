Ado-Ekiti – The Ekiti State Police Command on Saturday arrested a man, believed to be a political thug, with amulet as he tried to gain access into the venue of the rescheduled All Progressives Congress, APC, primary amid tight security and a show of solidarity among many of the 33 aspirants against Minister of Solid Minerals, Dr Kayode Fayemi. It would be recalled that like last week, majority of the aspirants wore white attires, as a symbol of solidarity. Observers say they were protesting against Dr Kayode Fayemi, Minister of Solid Minerals Development and former Governor of the state. Security has been beefed up at the venue of the APC primary, with operatives of the Nigeria Custom, Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corp, Federal Road Safety Corp and a heavy detachment of policemen from outside the state. Eight roadblocks were mounted on each of the two roads leading to the venue, and delegates and other stakeholders who passed through them were thoroughly frisked, even the women among them. Two filling stations beside the Damlek Events Centre venue of the primary, did not open for business. The stations, an NNPC and FIVE Os, were converted into car parks by the security operatives from outside the state. The two stations were also converted to command posts by the security outfits. 2 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
