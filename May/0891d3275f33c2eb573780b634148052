Japanese human resources services provider Recruit Holdings Co (6098.T) said on Wednesday it will buy Glassdoor Inc for 1.2 billion dollars. This is to enable it to tap into the California-based job-site operator’s database of company reviews and salary data. Privately held Glassdoor, founded in 2007, last raised funds in 2016, valuing the company at one billion dollars. It counts billionaire Chase Coleman’s hedge fund Tiger Global Management, Google Capital, and T. Rowe Price among its investors. Buying Glassdoor will expand Recruit’s reach in the United States, a market it tapped through its acquisition of Connecticut-based job search site Indeed, in 2012. “Glassdoor’s database of employer information and the job search capabilities of Indeed complement each other well,’’ Recruit’s Chief Operating Officer, Hisayuki Idekoba, said in a statement. Glassdoor will continue to be led by its current chief executive and co-founder, Robert Hohman, Recruit said. The recruit will fund the deal with cash on hand and expects it to close during the July-September quarter, subject to regulatory approvals. Earlier this year, media reported, citing official sources that Glassdoor was interviewing banks to advise on an IPO expected in the second half of the year. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
