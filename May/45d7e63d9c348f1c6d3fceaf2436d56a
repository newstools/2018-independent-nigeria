ABUJA – Justice John Tsoho of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Friday declined granting a restraining order stopping the Nigeria Eagles Supporters Club from parading themselves as supporters club in the country. Since the formation and subsequent incorporation of the Nigeria Eagles Supporters Club (NESC), the Dr Rafiu Ladipo-led Nigeria Football Supporters Club (NFSC), the country’s football fans’ club has been in disarray. Dissatisfied with the incorporation of Nigeria Eagles Supporters, the Nigeria Football Supporters Club headed to court to seek an order of perpetual injunction restraining them (NESC) from parading themselves or operating as a supporters club. Also joined in the suit as 2nd respondent is the Corporate Affairs Commission. Initially the applicant (Nigeria Football Supporters Club) had come by way of motion exparte, however, the presiding judge, Justice Tsoho declined granting an interim injunction but instead ordered that the Nigeria Eagles Supporters Club be put on notice. Consequently, the applicant had to file a motion on notice seeking two reliefs. Prayer one was for an order of perpetual injunction restraining the 1st respondent (NESC) by itself or through its members from parading or purporting to be the Nigeria Eagles Supporters Club. Prayer two sought an order for interim suspension of the incorporation of the 1st respondent (Nigeria Eagles Supporters Club) by the 2nd the respondent. However, delivering ruling on the application on Friday,  Justice Tsoho struck out the motion. Having considered affidavit evidence and arguments of all counsel, “I hold the view that the applicant’s application is not sustained, and it is therefore struck out” Justice Tsoho held. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
