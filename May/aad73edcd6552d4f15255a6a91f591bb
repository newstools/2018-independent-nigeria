Total telecommunications solutions provider, Globacom, has called on Nigerians to exercise the spirit of  patriotism on the occasion of this year’s  Democracy Day, which  is a day set aside for commemorating  the restoration of democracy in  Nigeria. Globacom posited that Nigerians, while celebrating the day which falls on May 29th, should also reflect on the virtues which will further strengthen the geographical entity called Nigeria with a view to contributing their quota to its enhanced growth and development. According to the company, patriotism encompasses loyalty and service to fatherland, love and goodwill towards fellow compatriots, spreading of peace and laying of emphasis on the virtues that unite us rather than the vices that divide us. “Patriotism is also an avowed commitment to making the country work in our daily endeavours and a readiness to make sacrifices for its defence”, the company opined. Quoting a Greek proverb, which says “If a man does not boast about his house, it will fall on him”, Globacom reiterated that all Nigerians must work towards preserving the country’s identity as a nation of progressive, conscientious and God-fearing people who have interest in its wellness and continued existence. Globacom commended Nigerians for unbroken sustenance of democracy in the last 19 years, adding that citizens should endeavour to keep all centrifugal forces at bay especially as the country enters another election year. The network assured its customers of its voice and data services which carry an array of benefits, saying the services will be available during and after the public holiday. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
