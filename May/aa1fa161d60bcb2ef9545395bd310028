Abuja – National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members have been advised to be security-conscious in their respective host communities during the service year. Brigadier-General Suleiman Kazaure, the director-general, gave this advice recently while addressing the 2018 Batch ‘A’ Corps members at the Orientation Camp in Obubra, Cross River State. Kazaure, who said they would be posted to new environments after the Orientation Course, urged them to be wary of people with questionable characters, but conduct themselves as role models and responsible leaders. He warned the female corps members to avoid dresses that might contradict the cultural beliefs of their host communities. The director-general also urged them to strive and add value to their host communities by leaving good legacies through developmental projects that would ameliorate their sufferings. “Avoid unauthorised journey. Don’t indulge in night parties and make sure you conduct yourselves as good ambassadors at all times,” Kazaure said. While presenting the 2,116 corps members in camp to the DG, Ambekemo Eniola, the state coordinator, said they had been actively engaged in all camp activities. She, however, lamented that the camp was yet to be connected to the national grid, which has made the camp to rely solely on power generating set as its source of electricity. 2 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
