Lagos – Enyimba International of Aba will today play CARA Brazzaville of Congo in their second Group C match of the CAF Confederation Cup. In their first group game at home, Enyimba defeated Djoliba of Mali 2-0 and will be out today for another victory. On the other hand, CARA Brazzaville will seek their first points of the group stage, after they lost their opener to Ivoirien side, AC Williamsville on Matchday 1. Meanwhile, Enyimba’s chairman, Chief Felix Anyansi-Agwu has charged the players to win the three maximum points. “We’ve done all things best possible to ensure that we play well and grab the three maximum points at stake. “Part of the efforts was arriving Brazaville early so as to allow for adequate rest and preparation before going in for the match. “We are leaving no stone unturned and I want to believe that the players will not disappoint on the field of play,” he said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
