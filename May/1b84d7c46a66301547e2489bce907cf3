Nicolas Terraz, Managing Director/Chief Executive, Total Upstream Companies in Nigeria, has explained the rationale for the company’s sponsorship of sports in Africa. Total is the official sponsor of the Africa Cup of Nations since 2016 with the tournament now re-christened Total Africa Cup of Nations. Only last week, the company delved into the sponsorship of Nigerian basketball, albeit, divisions one and two leagues. Speaking during the signing ceremony of their sponsorship of the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) divisions 1&2 in Lagos, Terraz said that Africa was the cornerstone of Total’s global presence and also central to their 20-year ambition to become the preferred energy partner in Africa. Consequently, he said that signing the agreement, was a bold step in keeping with their philosophy and ambition. “By so doing, we acknowledge thatwe are part of the makeup of Nigeria where we have been for more than 60 years. We are only too aware that in Nigeria, sport simply means unity, friendship, solidarity and energy.” Ahmadu Kida Musa, NBBF president, while commending Total, said that their commitment to sponsor the national divisions 1&2 leagues again affirmed the love the company has for Nigerian sports. He said that Total’s commitment underscores the importance the company attached towards uplifting the Nigerian youth. He added that the signing ceremony was an epoch event in the annals of Nigerian basketball on the premise that this was the first time the Federation was securing sponsorship for any of its lower leagues. “Without Total’s sponsorship, it will be impossible to administer this event to enable it achieve it’s set objectives,” he said. 0 comments
