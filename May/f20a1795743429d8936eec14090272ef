South Korean President, Moon Jae-in, on Friday pledged best efforts to engage with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to stop confrontation and help unite people of the divided Koreas. According to the Presidential Blue House, Moon made the remarks during a lunch meeting with South Korean artists, who visited Pyongyang in April, to do art performance. “I will do my best to let exchanges between the South and the North flow without stopping,’’ Moon said. He expressed gratitude for the artists as their performance played a significant role in inter-Korean relations, saying he realised what a great power the cultural and sports exchanges between the two Koreas could have. South Korean art group’s visit to Pyongyang was a reciprocation to the DPRK’s dispatch of artists to the 2018 Winter Olympics that was held in February at South Korea’s east county of PyeongChang. South Korea and the DPRK fielded a joint women’s ice hockey team during the Winter Olympics, which was the first unified Olympic team between the two sides. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
