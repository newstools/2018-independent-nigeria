Uyo – Chairman of U J Esuene Sports Club, Iniobong Esuene, has promised to revive squash in the country. He said on Monday that he instituted a squah tournament in Uyo because he realized that the sport was no longer growing in the country. “I organize this tournament because the game is gradually dying in this country. “There was a time Nigeria was ranked number three in the world in this game, but today we have neglected squash,” he said. He said that the essence of building a court was to provide a venue for players of all ages to play with the aim of producing talents. As part of the efforts at developing the sport, he said that the club has sponsored several players to national and international competitions, calling on the government and the private sector to invest in the game. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
