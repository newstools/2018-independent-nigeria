In the last couple of years, stylish, Afro-Caribbean-Latina Artist, Miss-K seemed to have taken a back seat from the flashing lights and camera. But anyone who attended the premiere of Teco Benson’s latest movie, ‘Just one Blood’, which took place in London, on May 18, the eve of the Royal Wedding, would have spotted her. Miss-K was one of the celebrities who graced the red carpet at the premiere this past weekend, making this moment her first red carpet appearance in the last two years. She mingled freely, just like a fish back in water, its natural habitat ‘Just one Blood’ is a latest Nollywood film directed by Teco Benson, stars Nollywood actors like Zack Orji and Mofe Duncan. Among those in attendance were Hon. Desmond O. Elliott, Film Director & President Producers Guild of UK Malcom Benson, and CANUK Chairman Dr.Boma Douglas and his wife, just to name a few. Since her hiatus from the entertainment scene, her look and actions at the premiere made it clear that she is back and ready again for showbiz. If nothing else, her striking glamorous outfit and neon pink hair certainly got everyone’s attention. Majorly though, Miss-K’s re-entry into the entertainment scene was not only based on speculations generated by her looks. The artiste staged a comeback on her social media platforms, just a few weeks back by unveiling the cover of her coming book titled: ‘Powerful Beauty: Breaking barriers with Kurls, Kurves and Konfidence’. She unveiled the book cover on April 23, which is also the United Nations International Book and Copyright day. The book she shared would be released later in the summer. Definitely looking no worse for the wear following her hibernation, Miss-K is making a strong come back. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
