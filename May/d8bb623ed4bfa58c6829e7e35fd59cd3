Ughelli – Oil-bearing communities in Delta State under the Oil Mining and Lease (OML) 30 have asked Heritage Energy Operational Service Limited (HEOSL) to take immediate step to put in place a new Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU based on the Chevron model, if it was really committed to a fresh start of operations in the area. The communities, during a Town Hall meeting between HEOSL and cluster communities held at Ughelli and Oleh, pointed out that a copy of such GMoU should be made available to all concerned communities for proper study before any agreement could be reached with the company. The meeting with the theme ‘Entering a New Era of Partnership’ was put in place by HEOSL to discuss conditions for the commencement of operations in OML 30 by the company. A communiqué issued at the end of the meetings, signed by community representatives and which is to stand as working documents for further engagement with the communities, read in part: “HEOSL should commence the process of payments of all outstanding scholarship and collection of forms for new scholarship. “Strong mechanism should be put in place to ensure the employment and engagement of indigenes into management positions in the company. “HEOSL should, as a matter of principle, commence the engagement of competent and qualified community contractors outside grass-cutting and house-keeping jobs. “Salaries of contract workers should be paid promptly and should be allowed to grow. The period for this form of community engagement should be specified, so that communities can be well informed and prepare adequately towards it.” 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
