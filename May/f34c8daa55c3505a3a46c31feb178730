Ughelli – Ukwuani Local Government Council has handed over Umutu Utra-modern Market project to Delta State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission,  DESOPADEC, for completion, urging the commission  to meet the architectural and aesthetic specifications conceived by the council before the commencement of the work a decade ago. Ogbuefi Chukwudi Dafe, the chairman of the council, while responding to the enquiry brought before him by the high powered delegation from Umutu community on why the works on the market were put on hold, explained that  he gave the directive as there were gross errors in the report about the market as filed by Hon (Barr.) Benedicta Ndudi Izuegbu-Osakunih, the immediate council chairman, that needed to be put straight. He added that the manner with which DESOPADEC took over, and started work in the market was contrary to extant due process, noting that the Umutu Utra-modern Market was almost 60-80 percent done as there was nothing to be reconstructed in the market other than completion. The council boss who also led the delegation through the length and breadth of the Umutu Market, showed them the standard of work he did in the market which was in contrast with the substandard work the contractor was doing, and insisted that while DESOPADEC will continue with the work, the council will monitor work progress to ensure that it the commission meets the specified standard. He also directed that the project Signpost which reads: “Re-construction of Umutu Market” should be changed to “Completion of Umutu Market by DESOPADEC”. He however lauded the initiator of the idea for the completion of the market, adding that he meant well for the Umutu people as well as every community in Ukwuani local government area, hence he is insisting that the work should be done right. Responding, Hon (Chief) Christopher Nwajiogoli thanked the chairman for his respect for due process and also assured him that the community will ensure that the market is completed according to specifications. 0 comments
