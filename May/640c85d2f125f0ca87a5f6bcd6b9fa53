The decision by the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to hold rates steady at 14 per cent has pitched economists against one another on whether the move is the right call against falling inflation and slow growth. Inflation dropped for the fifteenth consecutive month in April to 12.48 per cent from slower rises in prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, while first quarter GDP slowed to 1.9 per cent year-on-year, easing from an upwardly revised 2.1 percent growth in the previous period. The movements in price level and growth were not convincing enough for the MPC to alter the benchmark rate, which it has held steady since raising it by 200 basis points in July 2016. In holding rates, the MPC merely resorted to “a speculative exercise” says Bongo Adi, Economics lecturer at the Lagos Business School (LBS) of the Pan African University. The monetary body failed to look at economic data. He draws attention to the negative correlation between growth and the macroeconomic rates in the last decade, saying that “When MPR and CRR were relatively low, Nigeria registered historical growth levels. But when these rates were high, growth seems to have been penalised”. Dr. Adi says that “taking financial depth as a measure we see that the Nigerian financial system has become shallower than a decade ago”. He doesn’t see much sense in tightening monetary rates while expanding budget on the other hand. But Ayo Teriba, Chief Executive Officer of Economic Associates, thinks the MPC made the right call because cutting rates now “can reverse the gains that we’ve made” in reducing inflation, GDP growth and exchange rate management. “I don’t think the central bank will ease until inflation is in single digits”, he says. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
