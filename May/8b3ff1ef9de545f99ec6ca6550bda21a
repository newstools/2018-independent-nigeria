The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Friday in Abuja said its voter register was not substantially used for the February 10 Kano State local government election. Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairman, disclosed this while briefing newsmen on the commission’s investigation committee report on the alleged participation of under-aged persons in the election. INEC on February 21 set up an investigation committee chaired by a National Commissioner, Mr Abubakar Nahuche. The committee was to look into the allegations that under-aged persons voted in the election, using the register of voters given to the Kano State Independent Electoral Commission (KANSIEC) by INEC as prescribed by law. Yakubu said though the commission did not receive any formal complaint on the matter, the committee was set up to address concerns that could create doubt about voter register in preparations for 2019 general elections. The chairman said that the committee had since submitted its report and while INEC had carefully considered and accepted its finding and recommendations. “Based on its terms and reference, there are four key points in the findings and recommendations of the committee, which may be summarised as follows: “KANSIEC requested for and received from INEC the Kano state register of voters for the elections. The register was produced for use for the elections. “However, the register was only sighted in a few polling units. In other words, the register was not used in most of the polling units. 0 comments
