Yola – This is coming three days after suicide bombers attacked and killed dozens of residents in Mubi Local Government Area of the state. Confirming the incident to newsmen in Yola, the Adamawa State capital, the council chairman said three villages in the area were attacked and completely burnt down by suspected Fulani herdsmen. The Chairman, Arnold Jibla, said on Thursday that the incident occurred Wednesday night, about 9p.m. On the number of casualties recorded in the crisis, the chairman said the casualty figure was still not clear but listed the villages attacked to include Bolki, Bang, and Gon. In their separate reactions, Haruna Furo, the Head of Adamawa State Emergency Management Agency (ADSEMA), and Malam Abbani Imam, the state Coordinator of National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), confirmed the attack. SP Othman Abubakar, the state Police Public Relations Officer, confirmed that 12 people were killed while 150 houses were burnt down. But eyewitnesses told DAILY INDEPENDENT that the death toll was over 50 because many residents had gone to sleep before the incident occurred. Numan Local Government Area and other nearby settlements have experienced several herdsmen killings in the past six months. This culminated in the military relocating its base to the affected area – a move ostensibly aimed at restoring peace. On Tuesday, forty-two persons died while 68 were injured in twin blasts in Mubi town, a city some 200 kilometres (125 miles) from the Adamawa State capital. 0 comments
