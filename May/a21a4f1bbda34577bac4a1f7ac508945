The Zambian government said on Wednesday that it would consider reviewing some current laws that impede media freedoms in the country. Minister of Information and Broadcasting Dora Siliya said her ministry has already drafted the National Information and Media Policy to guide the continued growth of the country’s media industry. “To this end, the policy proposes a review of some current laws to further strengthen freedom of the press and the rights of citizens in Zambia,” she said in a statement to launch the commemorative activities of the 2018 World Press Freedom Day which falls on May 3. The theme for this year’s commemoration is “Keeping Power in Check: Media, Justice and the Rule of Law”. The Zambian minister said the theme reminds journalists in the country to be responsible in their work as they yield tremendous power on behalf of the people. She also said her ministry was currently working with other relevant government departments to strengthen existing defamation laws and provide for cyber laws in order to protect citizens against bad media practitioners. She said currently, authorities in Zambia have issued 115 radio licenses and 45 television licenses as well as 11 for newspapers. Journalists in Zambia have over the years complained of bad media environment and have been calling on authorities to review some archaic laws. The Media Institute of Southern Africa Zambia Chapter said the media environment makes it hard for journalists to report the truth in many instances. 0 comments
