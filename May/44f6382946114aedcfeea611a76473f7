Super Eagles winger, Ahmed Musa, believes playing as a team at the summer World Cup in Russia will ensure the team qualifies for the second round of the tournament. The player, who acknowledges they were “underdogs’’, said that they need to play not as individuals, but together to take on a tough group, including Argentina and their talisman, Lionel Messi. “We are not playing Messi but Argentina, it’s all about team work, with or without Messi, and our focus is to perform better in the World Cup,” Musa who plays in Russia for CSKA Moscow also said. “We have to be looking at the quality of our players — and I believe we are going to Russia to do well — and not the quality of other countries’ players,’’ he told Reuters. Nigeria will kickoff their World Cup campaing against Croatia ranked 18th on June 16 before playing Iceland that are ranked on June 22 and last group game against Argentina ranked fifth on June 26. The team’s best efforts have included reaching the round of 16 three times, in 1994, 1998 and the previous World Cup in Brazil in 2014. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
