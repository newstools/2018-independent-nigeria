Real Madrid are certain Cristiano Ronaldo will be fit for the Champions League final, and have not ruled out the possibility of him playing in La Liga again this season, Goal reports. The Portuguese was withdrawn at half-time of Sunday’s draw with Barcelona having picked up an ankle injury in the process of scoring in the early stages at Camp Nou. Concerned Real supporters feared the worst for their star forward, who has scored 15 goals in 12 European appearances this season to lead them to the final against Liverpool in Kiev on May 26. Blancos boss Zinedine Zidane initially eased those fears, claiming the injury was only a sprain and that it would be unlikely for him to miss the final . And Goal understands that after further tests the club are happy with how their prized asset is shaping up, with Ronaldo himself having spent Monday morning starting his recovery at the club’s training ground. Despite that, Ronaldo will definitely miss Wednesday’s clash with Sevilla in the Primera Division and is highly likely to be ruled out of Saturday’s match against Celta Vigo. Cristiano Ronaldo is to have a scan on an ankle injury but is likely to be fit for Real Madrid’s Champions League final with Liverpool, says boss Zinedine Zidane. Real are trying to win the Champions League for a third successive season. They meet Liverpool in the final in Kiev, Ukraine on May 26. Ronaldo scored his 25th league goal of the season in the game against Barcelona. Real are third in La Liga, 15 points behind champions Barcelona. Zidane’s side have three more league games before they meet Liverpool in a repeat of the 1981 European Cup final. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
