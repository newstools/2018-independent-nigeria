ASABA – The Urhobo Progress Union (UPU) has raised an alarm over the alleged short-changing of the Urhobo nation in Delta State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (DESOPADEC), especially on disbursement of funds. Olorogun Moses Taiga, the UPU President-General (PG), who spoke during a courtesy visit of national officers of the union to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa in Asaba, expressed dissatisfaction with the exclusion of the Urhobo ethnic nationality in the disbursement of DESOPADEC’s monthly payment of N100million to Oil Producing ethnic nationalities in the three senatorial districts. He also regretted the exclusion of Urhobo in funds for pipelines security, “in spite of the many oil pipelines crisscrossing Urhobo land.” Taiga explained that when what other ethnic nationalities that occupy Delta South Senatorial District receives from DESOPADEC was summed up, what was arrived at was far and above that of Urhobo, who he describe as sole occupiers of Delta Central Senatorial District, with its eight LGAs. Governor Okowa, in his response, said he understand the importance of the Urhobo nation in the state and promised to continue to accord respect to them and to work with the UPU to ensure the needed partnership. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
