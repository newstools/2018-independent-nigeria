The shattered father of the four children killed in the Margaret River family shooting massacre says he still loves the man believed responsible for their deaths – their grandfather. Peter Miles, his wife Cynda, daughter Katrina and Mr Cockman’s four children – daughter Taye, 13, and sons Rylan, 12, Arye, 10, and Kadyn Cockman, eight – were found dead at the Miles’ Osmington property, northeast of Margaret River in Western Australia on Friday. “I still love who Peter was. If it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t have Katrina, I wouldn’t have her kids,” Aaron Cockman told reporters, speaking publicly for the first time since the tragedy. “So it’s not some random guy off the street who’s taken them away from me – he gave them to me and now he’s taken them away. “If it had to happen, there is no better person than that.” Mr Cockman, who was estranged from Katrina, said he had not spoken to Peter and Cynda “since they cut me off from my kids” but being angry served no purpose. “Anger will destroy you. I’m sad but I’ll get through this.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
