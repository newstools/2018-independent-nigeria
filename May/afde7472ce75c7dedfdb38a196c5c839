AWKA – The couple whose twin boys were found dead in a deep freezer in their house in Egbu, Otolo Nnewi of Anambra State on Saturday took their corpses home for burial saying they would not want the matter to be made a police case. The parents, Mr. and Mrs. Nwachukwu Onwe, from Ebonyi State took their late children, Peter and Paul, home for burial. Mr. Haruna Mohammed, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, confirmed the story saying: “the father of the children is not helping matters. They would not want to make the matter a police case.  He has asked the police to release his children to him for burial”. Mohammed, however, said investigation would continue while assuring that the perpetrators would be brought to book. Peter and Paul were reportedly found lifeless in an abandoned deep freezer in their apartment on Saturday. The situation threw the community into frenzy as a case of suspected ritual killings. It was gathered that the deceased, aged six, had returned to their mother’s shop after school on Friday before their mum instructed them to go home and undress before coming back to the shop for their lunch, but they never returned. A family source said, “The mother became worried after waiting for a while for them to come back as instructed, and quickly dashed home to find out what could have kept them back. “But to her greatest surprise, she didn’t see any of them at home.” “The man and his wife, together with some of us started going from house to house, asking if anybody knew about the children’s whereabouts, but all efforts were to no avail. “It was the following morning that the lifeless bodies of the twins were found inside an abandoned freezer”. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
