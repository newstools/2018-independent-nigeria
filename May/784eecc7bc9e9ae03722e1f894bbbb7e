Venus Williams had a brief outing at the Mutua Madrid Open as she lost in the first round on Saturday against Anett Kontaveit. However, before the start of the tournament, the 37-year-old spoke about who she thought are the greatest players of all time. “I think it’s difficult to speak about the whole history because you had great players in every moment, but I would definitely include Rafa (Nadal) and Roger (Federer) among the best.’ Then she reflected further. ‘It’s obvious that Serena is the greatest player of all time. “I am her sister, I won’t tell you another thing.” On Serena’s comeback, she mentioned, “She is working hoping to come back to play in Rome and Roland Garros. There is no reason why she can’t continue.” Venus finally commented on Maria Sharapova’s autobiography Unstoppable: My Life So Far. “I didn’t read it, but I may do it. What I know is that I don’t believe that I will write one.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
