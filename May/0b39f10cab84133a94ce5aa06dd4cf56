Mohamed Salah set a new Premier League scoring record as Liverpool sealed a place in next season’s Champions League with an empathic victory over Brighton. It was an impressive performance on a perfect sunny afternoon at Anfield and Jurgen Klopp’s side lingered long after the final whistle, soaking up the celebratory atmosphere with the Champions League final against Real Madrid to come on 26 May. Salah was the centre of attention as he was feted on his side’s home pitch after the match. There was the Golden Boot for Premier League’s top scorer to be presented, the club’s player of the year trophy too. The forward was clearly moved, and he shared the moment with his wife and young daughter. It was his record goal that set the Reds on course to blowing Brighton away. The opener, a low finish from Dominic Solanke’s pass, was his 32nd goal of the campaign – the most by a player in a 38-game Premier League season. Dejan Lovren doubled the lead by powerfully heading in Andrew Robertson’s cross and after the break it was more of the same – Liverpool continued to dominate. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
