Abuja – The embattled former spokesperson of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olisa Metuh, on Monday morning collapsed in a courtroom at the Federal High Court Abuja. Metuh was back in court, after the trial judge, Justice Okon Abang had on April 19 barred him from travelling abroad for medical treatment due to his failing health. At the resumption of the trial, when the criminal charge was called for hearing, Metuh in the process of trying to enter the dock box, probably missed a step and landed uncontrollably on the floor. It took the intervention of medical personnel and Metuh’s relatives to help carry him up. Events on the matter are unfolding, as Justice Abang insisted going on with the trial. However, Emeka Etiaba SAN, counsel to Metuh, submitted that he cannot go on when his client was lying critically ill on a stretcher. “The 1st defendant had a terrible fall while trying to mount the dock, and I don’t even know if he is alive on that stretcher, Etiaba stated. “Since the court has insisted on proceeding with the trial, I announce my withdrawal from the trial” Etiaba stated. However, Justice Abang in a bench ruling refused Etiaba’s withdrawal. Details later… 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
