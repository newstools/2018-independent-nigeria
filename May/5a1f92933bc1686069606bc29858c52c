A 41-year-old man, Oko Idoreyin, was on Wednesday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos, charged with attempting to murder a female neighbour with an axe. Idoreyin, a resident of Alimosho, Ipaja, Lagos with no stated occupation, is being tried on a count charge of attempted murder. Police Sgt. Godwin Awase, the prosecutor, told the court that the accused committed the offence on April 17 at his residence. He said that the accused attempted to murder Mrs. Vera Amda, by using an axe to inflict a cut on her head. “The accused used the axe to cut the victim’s head for reason known to him,” the prosecutor said. Awase said that the woman was on her way to work in the morning when the accused pursed her with an axe. “The accused ran after the woman with an axe, caught up with her and used the axe to break her head. “Blood gushed out of her head and neighbours quickly rushed her to the hospital. “Neighbours reported the case to the police and the accused was immediately arrested. The victim is still in critical condition at the hospital,” he said. The prosecutor said the offence contravened Section 230 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The section prescribes a life jail term for attempted murder. The accused pleaded innocence of the offence and was granted bail in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum. The Magistrate, Mrs. F. F. George, said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidences of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government.
