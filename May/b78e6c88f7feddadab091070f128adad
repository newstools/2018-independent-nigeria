The urban inflation rate eased by 12.89 percent (year-on-year) in April 2018 from 13.75 percent recorded in March, while the rural inflation rate also eased by 12.13 percent in April 2018 from 12.99 percent in March.

The Composite Food Index rose by 14.80 percent in April 2018. The rise in the index was caused by increases in prices of potatoes, yam and other tubers, fish, bread and cereals, oil and fats, vegetables, meat, coffee, tea, cocoa, milk, cheese, and eggs. On a month-on-month basis, the Food sub-index increased by 0.91 percent in April 2018, up by 0.01 percent points from 0.90 percent recorded in March. The average annual rate of change of the food sub-index for the twelve-month period ending April 2018 over the previous twelve-month average was 18.89 percent, 0.4 percent points from the average annual rate of change recorded in March (19.29) percent. Analysts at Cordros Capital said they find the marginal decline in the month-on-month headline inflation rate contentious, as it clearly conflicts with the simultaneous month-on-month increases in both food and core inflation rates. “All in all, we note the sustained stickiness in general price levels, highlighted by m/m headline CPI ranging between 0.80 percent – 0.83 percent since the turn of the year. “That, to us, is concerning, considering significant upside risk factors to inflation beyond H1-18, more so when the lingering base effect would have lost its steam,” the analysts said. The research team of United Capital are of the view that high base effect from elevated food prices in the prior year accounted for the sustained moderation in headline inflation, the major items responsible in the food index included potatoes, yam and other tubers, bread & cereals, oil & fats, fruits & vegetables, coffee tea & cocoa, milk cheese & eggs and fish. Moderation in prices of fuel and lubricants maintenance and repair, vehicle spare parts, and garments, clothing materials and other articles of clothing plus clothing accessories also supported the core index. “For the headline index, the highest increases were observed in the prices of potatoes, yam and other tubers, bread & cereals, oil & fats, fruits & vegetables, coffee tea & cocoa, milk cheese & eggs and fish. “Looking ahead, we expect the recent deceleration in headline inflation to be sustained, supported by a continued pullback in food inflation, thanks to base effects from 2017 and continued stability in the FX market. However, the feedback effect from the herdsmen crisis in Benue State, Taraba State and environ, is disturbing, especially on food inflation. “To this end, we highlight the marginal uptick in m/m food inflation (to 0.91% in Apr-18) for a second consecutive month, after touching 0.85 percent in Feb-18. “Nevertheless, we project May-18 inflation rate to decelerate faster, to 11.3 percent (below the CBN’s target of 12.0%), with m/m inflation rate anticipated to steady at 0.82 percent month-on-month. “At 12.5 percent, Nigeria’s real interest rate (MPR less headline inflation) improved to 1.5percent from 0.7percent in Mar-18, the first time in two years of negative real interest rate. “While this indicates a further re-pricing in the yield environment, recent aggressive liquidity mop-up exercise by the CBN may off-set sharp moderation in yields,” they added.  0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
