Lagos – Super Eagles and Leicester City midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, is a serious doubt for the summer World Cup in Russia after The Foxes confirmed that the player would be out for six weeks following a hamstring injury he sustained in their 0-5 loss to Crystal Palace in an EPL game last weekend. The World Cup will kick off on June 14 with an opening match between hosts, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, and Nigeria will engage Croatia two days later. Ndidi will be expected to have fulkly recovered for the tournament around the second week of June, meaning that the former youth international will be running against time to be fit, hence a big doubt for selection by Coach Gernot Rohr. This is coming even as Coach Gernot Rohr will on May 14, 2018 announce a 35-man provisional roster for the World Cup. Consequently, Rohr and the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) have a big decision to make, whether to name Ndidi for the World Cup with the hope that he will be fit before Nigeria’s first game against Croatia on June 16. ”Ndidi will be ready for the World Cup. The result of the scan is out, they will put him on a programme to get him back to fitness,” a top source was quoted as saying by an online medium. ”He will initially be out of action for four weeks and will need two weeks extra to be fully fit.” On Tuesday, Ndidi was named Leicester City’s Young Player of the Season for the second year running; he was one of the key players for the Nigerian national team during the World Cup qualifiers. 0 comments
