The UN will honour three Nigerian peacekeepers, as the world marks the 2018 International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers to be commemorated on June 1, at the UN headquarters in New York. The fallen Nigerian peacekeepers to be honoured includes Lt. Col. Ali Suleiman, who served with the UN Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Others are Warrant Officer Remmy Amakwe, who was deployed with the African Union–United Nations Mission in Darfur; and Mr Kolawole Shogaolu, who served in a civilian capacity in the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali. Nigeria is the 41st largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN peacekeeping, according to a recent statistics. It currently contributes more than 500 military and police personnel to the UN peace operations in Abyei, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Lebanon, Mali, Sudan, South Sudan and the Western Sahara. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres would lay a wreath to honour those who lost their lives while in the service of peace and would also officiate at a ceremony to posthumously present the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal to the 129 military, police and civilian personnel who lost their lives in peacekeeping operations during 2017. Currently, more than 96,000 uniformed personnel from 124 troop- and-police-contributing countries serve under the blue flag, alongside more than 15,000 international and national civilian staff and nearly 1,600 United Nations Volunteers. In his message to mark the Day, Secretary-General António Guterres announced that he would spend the Day with United Nations Peacekeepers in Mali “to express my solidarity with colleagues facing high casualties and enormous volatility.” This year also marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of UN Peacekeeping, the flagship enterprise of the Organization described by the Secretary-General as “a proven investment in global peace, security and prosperity.” “We express our gratitude to the more than one million men and women who have served under the UN flag, saving countless lives. We honour the more than 3,700 blue helmets who have paid the ultimate price over the past seven decades. “And we pay tribute to the 14 peacekeeping missions working around the clock to protect people and advance the cause of peace,” according to Guterres. At a time of increasingly complex conflicts and rising peacekeeper fatalities, the Secretary-General said: “As we recognize a legacy of service and sacrifice around the world, I am also committed to taking Action for Peacekeeping – action to make our operations more effective and safer in today’s challenging environments.” Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, said: “Our peacekeepers – civilian, police, men and women, military personnel – save lives every day”. “Today, we honour those who have sacrificed their lives in service to peace. Their service and sacrifice inspires us to work harder to support a sustainable peace in some of the world’s most complex and challenging places.” Under-Secretary-General for Field Support, Atul Khare, said: “We owe a debt of gratitude to the brave men and women who risk their lives every day in service to others, and we grieve with the families and nations of our fallen colleagues”. “But beyond gratitude, we owe our peacekeepers all the support we can muster to ensure they are well-equipped, well-trained and well-prepared to complete their missions successfully.” The General Assembly established the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers in 2002 to pay tribute to all men and women serving in peacekeeping, and to honour the memory of those who have lost their lives in the cause of peace. The Assembly designated 29 May as the Day because it was the date in 1948 when the first UN peacekeeping mission – the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization – began operations in the Middle East. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
