Lagos – Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) has announced that some areas under its operational territory would start experiencing power outage from today, Thursday. The company conveyed this in a statement by its General Manager, Corporate Communications, Mr. Godwin Idemudia, and attributed the development to technical maintenance work being carried out by Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) The release listed areas to be affected by the power outage as Apapa, Amuwo, Festac, Ojo, Okokomaiko, and Ijanikin. Others include Iba, Agbara, Badagry, Ibeju, Ajah and their adjoining areas. Apologising for the inconvenience the power outage would cause its customers, the company further appealed to customers to bear with the situation, adding that the outage was beyond its control as the facilities being worked on wholly belong to Transmission Company of Nigeria. It, however, added that enough assurance had been received from TCN that the facility maintenance work would be expedited to ensure restoration of normal power supply to all affected areas in good time. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
