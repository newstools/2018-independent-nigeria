LAGOS – President, African Ship owners Association and former Director- General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Temisan Omatseye has said that Nigeria is losing about $300 million yearly, for offshore vessel berthing, especially, five degrees, East of Nigerian waters. Omotseye who stated this in Lagos, also urged the President Buhari- led Federal Government to look into the issues that would enable Nigerian ports run cheaper and become more attractive to port users. According to him, the foreign ship owners have taken over all the maritime businesses, while the ship-owners are left with nothing. “Nigerian shippers should be allowed to take charge of their goods as soon as they arrive the country, because this is what is applicable all over the world. “All the foreign ship owners will not allow Nigerians to get near vessels as soon as they arrive the country, in spite of being the landlord of the ports.” “We want government to assist Nigerian ship owners to be in charge because by so doing, they will create more employment for teaming youths. “Nigeria will soon be competing with its foreign counterparts with the recent equipment government had provided for the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) which is presently having multiplier effect on their operations,’’ Omotseye said. He commended NIMASA for the establishment of the National Seafarer Development Programme (NSDP), which he said, had assisted in the training of some Nigerian youths to the level of Sea time training; and advised youths that were yet to obtain the sea time training not to relent, adding that Nigeria need their services because most of the seafarers were ageing and there was the need for replacement. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
