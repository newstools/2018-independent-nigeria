Barcelona may have navigated their way past Real Madrid and Villarreal but their first ever-unbeaten La Liga season is not quite over the line yet. Ernesto Valverde’s Barca now just needs to avoid defeat at Levante and at home to Real Sociedad to become the first team in the modern era to go a whole La Liga season unbeaten. The last team to achieve the feat was Real Madrid in 1931/32 when there were 18 games in a season. Ernesto Valverde’s side visit Levante today (Sunday), whose lowly position of 16th betrays a late surge in form, which has included four consecutive victories and only one defeat in their last 10 games. Barca are clear favourites. They held on for a 2-2 draw at home to Real last Sunday, even after Sergi Roberto was sent off at the end of the first half, before thrashing sixth-placed Villarreal 5-1 on Wednesday. But if those two games have caused any fatigue, or even complacency, among Spain’s league and cup winners, Levante could be primed to take advantage. When Paco Lopez replaced Juan Ramon Lopez Muniz as coach at the start of March, Levante had won only one of their last 22 games. Since he took charge, only Atletico Madrid have played them and tasted victory. “It was important to change the dynamics but I don’t know what changed so much,” Lopez said. “What we have is attitude and commitment and that has been the key.” Valverde has downplayed the importance of his team finishing the campaign as invincibles, but after already winning a domestic double, it would represent something of a cherry on top. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
