Chief Sunny Onuesoke, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain has called on the over 200 Atiku supports group in the state to harmonise and form a single formidable voice. The former governorship aspirant made this call when members and executives of Atikulated Agenda 2019 paid him a courtesy call over the weekend at the Atiku Care Media, South-South Regional Office in Warri. The group led by the state coordinator, Chief Joe Ugboma said the purpose of the courtesy visit was to rally prominent Deltans to key into the Atiku Agenda come 2019 and appeal to Onuesoke to be the navigator of the group course. In his reaction, Chief Onuesoke said the fragmentation of support groups for Atiku is not the best way possible, urging them to fuse into a single formidable body with one voice, saying that if this can be done, then they stand a chance of making headway. “Let me say for the avoidance of doubt that there are over 200 Atiku support groups in Delta State alone, which is a welcome development but my advice is, if they can come together and fused to become one formidable voice, then they can have a headway. “Atiku remains the best man for the job come 2019, he is detribalized, experienced and very consistent in his desire to see a strong, virile and egalitarian country where everyone will be given the opportunity to thrive and flourish” he added 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
