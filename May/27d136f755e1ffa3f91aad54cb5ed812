President Muhammadu Buhari’s appraisal of late military dictator Sani Abacha for his work in building infrastructure has spurred controversy among Nigerians. While some defended the President, others faulted him for hailing a “corrupt” past leader. According to Buhari’s critics, his commendation of Abacha could dent his anti-corruption campaign. Buhari had at the villa during the week said that regardless of what anyone thinks about Abacha, “it must be remembered that subsequent civilian presidents spent billions on naira in infrastructure yet have had little to show for it”. To many, Buhari’s comment was a means to justify his appointment by late Abach as the Petroleum Trust Fund head. A social media commentator,   Yahaya Jnr @MuktarYahaya1, accused the president of being tribalistic in his comment. He said: “ Lolz.. Tribalism has eaten into @MBuhari bone marrow. How can he be praising a man who took the country back to the 1st century through looting?” @naijateddy said: “So, in other words, you don’t condemn Abacha for looting all because he built roads? Is that the new logic in town?” “Looted 60 per cent of the funds and used 30 per cent to work. Then his cronies including Buhari looted the balance. And they said this is progress,” @Godson_Green added. “So we can rightly say PMB is continuing the Abacha Legacy abi . This is the man Bola Tinubu and co in the South West sold their people to, yet they claim they are part of  NADECO who fought the Abacha regime to a standstill. What an irony!”    AkinOmoAkin said. @Dalabi1 said: “Omg, PMB don fumble again. You praise Abacha, antagonizing Jonathan and OBJ. I’m done. Who is buying PVC plz I want to sell mine. Can’t be wasting my energy on this politicians again. Nonsense!” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
