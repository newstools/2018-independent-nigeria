The turf of Sani Abacha Stadium will be the proverbial grass that suffers when two elephants fight, as Kano Pillars host Rivers United in a week 23 Nigeria Professional Football League on Sunday. Pillars are aiming to close the gap with Lobi Stars at the top of the table. When both sides clashed at the same stadium last season, the home side won the match through a brace from Rabiu Ali, who found the net in the 54th and 60th minutes. But the Pride of Rivers responded rightly in the reverse leg in Port Harcourt, winning Pillars 2-1 with Junior Lokosa’s 32nd minute goal coming between Bamba Bakari’s goal in the 20th minute and Guy Kuimian’s strike in the 56th minute. Pillars are second on the log, four points behind leaders, Lobi Stars. The Sai Masu Gida have 36 points from 22 matches and will hope to edge their visitors and hope that Go Round will make their home count against Lobi in order for them to close the gap. A win for them and a loss for the leaders will reduce the gap to just one point. Meanwhile, the seventh-place Rivers United have 32 points from 22 matches and with eight points separating them from Lobi, an unlikely win for them will take their haul to 35 points, meaning that they will be closer to the top. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
