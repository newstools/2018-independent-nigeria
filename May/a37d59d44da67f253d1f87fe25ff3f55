The cat is out of the bag: Danny Boyle has been confirmed as the director for James Bond 25. The official Twitter account for James Bond (who knew he had one, eh?) announced the news this morning (May 25), confirming what we’d all been expecting. Unsurprisingly, Daniel Craig is definitely returning for James Bond 25 in what will be his fifth – and probably final – outing as the super-suave secret agent, 007. Oscar-winning director, and mastermind of the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony Boyle will be directing the movie, which will begin production in December this year. As rumoured, Boyle’s Trainspotting collaborator John Hodge has written an original screenplay for James Bond 25, so brace yourselves – it’s only a matter of time before those Ewan McGregor for Bond villain rumours begin to take shape. On the production side of things, we now know that MGM and Universal Pictures will work together to distribute the film worldwide, and it’s expected that the UK will get it first. According to Deadline, the 25th installment of the hugely-popular, and lucrative, James Bond franchise will be released in the UK in October next year before it hits the US in November. Craig was confirmed to return as Bond back in August last year, after two years of toying with our hearts and refusing to commit to his future as the beloved British spy. In his announcement, Craig teased that he “can’t wait” to “go out on a high note”. We think Boyle will certainly deliver that – and then som 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
