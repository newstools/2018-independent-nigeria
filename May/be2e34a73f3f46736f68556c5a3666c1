The coaches and players of FC IfeanyiUbah may be heading to a collision course with the management of the Nnewi side following their home capitulation last week, as SATURDAY INDEPENDENT has scooped that the players would be handed a difficult condition if this weekend’s match does not go their way. The Anambra Warriors will be the guests of Kwara United in Ilorin and, as has been gathered through a club source who pleaded not to be named, they must guide their loins and come back with a reasonable result or face the wrath of the management. It will be recalled that the Anambra Warriors fell 1-2 at home to Niger Tornadoes in one of the week 22 matches on Sunday. Mubarak Ejiogu scored for the visitors in the 72nd minute but Godwin Obaje leveled the proceeding inside two minutes added time before Bashir Usman scored again four minutes later to hand the visitors all the three points. The result elicited reactions from the fans of the club and the management, SATURDAY INDEPENDENT was told, has risen to the occasion with a demand for the players to win their next match against Kwara United or face the club’s hammer. “The whole players were in pensive mood after the match because we played very well and did not deserve to lose,” said the source, who is a player with the club. “They have mandated that we must win our next match against Kwara United or we face their anger but we are not sure what the anger is. The management should realise that football match results come in three ways; it is either you win, you lose or you draw. We are going to Ilorin to play our normal game and see how it will end,” said the player. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
