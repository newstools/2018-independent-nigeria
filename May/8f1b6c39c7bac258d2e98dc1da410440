Ado-Ekiti – Senator Bode  Olowoporoku, a Minister in the Second Republic, has clinched the Governorship Primary of the  Nigeria Democratic Congress Party (NDCP) in the July 14 governorship election in Ekiti State. Olowoporoku, who is also a former Minister of Science and Technology in the Second Republic, defeated Mr. Kunle Oluwalana, at the primary election of the party conducted in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital on Monday. The ex-senator polled 25 votes to beat Oluwalana who received 5 votes at the shadow election at the primary. Olowoporoku was one of the aspirants who contested for the ticket of the Mega Party of Nigeria (MPN) last Saturday but quit the party citing irregularities in the primary which produced Mr. Sunday Balogun as the winner. He later moved to NDCP alongside his supporters shortly after the MPN primary. The NCDP Founder, Dr. Johnson Edosomwan, described the primary as free, fair and transparent and commended delegates for conducting themselves peacefully throughout the process. He described Olowoporoku as an experienced and committed grassroots politician capable of winning the next governorship poll. Speaking shortly after Olowoporoku was declared the winner, Edosomwan said the party was poised to win the Ekiti governorship poll, adding ‘if voted to power, would create jobs, reduce poverty, provide quality healthcare delivery, and invest in agriculture to boost food security’. The NDCP chief who predicted that Olowoporoku would win on the basis of his connection to the grassroots and the manifesto of the party which he said is masses-oriented warned the electorates in Ekiti State against being deceived with cash, rice and other forms of inducement saying their future lies in their vote. 2 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
