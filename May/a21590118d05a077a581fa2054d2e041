Calabar – Steven Ukpukpen, a member of the Cross River State House of Assembly, representing Obudu State Constituency, slumped and died on Wednesday morning while on a road-walk exercise. It was gathered that the incident happened about 7a.m, and he was rushed to a private hospital but was later confirmed dead. Prof. Ben Ayade, Cross River State governor, in a statement by Christian Ita, his Chief Press Secretary, described as shocking and devastating the sad news of the lawmaker’s death. The governor said the sudden passing away of Ukpukpen had left him in a state of shock and disbelief. “I am completely numbed and bewildered that we have lost such a vibrant intellectual who, as a lawmaker, was deeply committed to the effort of our administration to build enduring legacies and bequeath strong economy for our people.” The governor noted that Ukpukpen died at a young age, especially when the state needed his skills and expertise in the art of lawmaking. Governor Ayade commiserated with the deceased’s immediate family, the state House of Assembly, the people of Obudu, as well as the entire state over the death of Ukpukpen, and prayed God to grant them the strength to cope with the unfortunate and depressing occurrence. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
