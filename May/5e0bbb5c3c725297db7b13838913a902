Heartland of Owerri will need a miracle to survive the drop at the end of the season going by their results. The Naze Millionaires were relegated at the end of the penultimate season but they made a quick return to the topflight after just one season in the Nigeria National League (NNL). But the former CAF Champions League finalists have shown everything but a form deserving of their status, as they continue to wallow at the foot of the table with 19 points from 21 matches heading into this weekend’s clash with Oriental neighbours, Rangers International, at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium in Enugu. They are meeting the Flying Antelopes when the former champions are relatively stable in terms of performances. Rangers are sitting eighth on the log with 30 points from 22 matches and will be favoured to take all the three points, especially going by Heartland’s abysmally poor away record this season. Meanwhile, Heartland will be hoping to upset the odds in Enugu and possibly win their fifth match of the season. They have lost 10 times this season and drew on seven occasions with a paltry four wins. With 19 points from 21 matches and -12 goals difference, Heartland must fight to at least get a draw in the match. Speaking to SATURDAY INDEPENDENT, Henry Echefu, the media officer of Naze Millionaires, said that they hope to get the desire result in Enugu in order to boost their survival chances, explaining that they are earnestly praying for the club’s survival. “We will travel to Enugu on Saturday against the match on Sunday. Our plan is to get at least a draw because all of us are praying to ensure that Heartland survive relegation,” he said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
