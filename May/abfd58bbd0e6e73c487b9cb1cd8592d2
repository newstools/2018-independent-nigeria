P/HARCOURT – A faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Rivers State sympathetic to Rotimi Amaechi, Transportation Minister, on Saturday shunned the order of the state High Court restraining the party from going ahead with the local government congress. The APC faction said it went on with the congress on Saturday because it never received any court order stopping the process as was being speculated. Chris Finebone, spokesman of the Amaechi faction, said the local government congress was held in all the local government areas of the state, adding, “We did not receive any court injunction. Whoever did that was an impostor.” Finebone also denied any instruction from the APC National Working Committee (NWC), in Abuja to suspended the Imo and Rivers states congresses, saying the exercise in the state was peaceful and orderly. He described such information as “most speculative”. He argued the Senator Magnus Abe faction could not have served them the order, as “local government congress cannot stand on its own. The exercise emanated from the ward congress. If they want to serve any order, they should have done so from the ward congress.” The APC spokesman also debunked the allegation mostly on social media that the Amaechi group of the party had obtained a parallel injunction from the Federal High court to go ahead with the congress. “We did not obtain any injunction from the Federal High court. That is fake”, he said. Meanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had denied aiding Senator Abe to destabilise the APC in the state. Abe, an APC governorship aspirant, had gone to court to obtain an interlocutory injunction to stop his party from going on with the local government congress, which was not in his favour. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
