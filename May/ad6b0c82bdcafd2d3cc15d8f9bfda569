Former Prime Minister of Macedonia, Nikola Gruevski, was sentenced to two years in prison on Wednesday for corruption, while another official got a six-and-a-half-year jail term. A Skopje Court found Gruevski, 47 and the former Assistant Interior Minister, Gjoko Poposki, guilty of taking a bribe in the 2012 purchase of a luxury armoured car worth 600,000 Euros (710,000 dollars). The interior minister at the time, Gordana Jankuloska, is awaiting judgment in the same case, as her verdict was delayed by her pregnancy. Gruevski, who headed Macedonia for 11 years until losing power in 2017, was not present for the sentencing. However, he is due to appear in court again on Thursday in another corruption case. Recently, he accused the court of running a political trial against him. His lawyer, Dimitar Dangov, said that the defence will appeal the verdict. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
