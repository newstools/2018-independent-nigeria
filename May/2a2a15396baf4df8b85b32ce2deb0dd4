Africa Machine Green (AMG) Energy Storage, Nigeria, has devised a power generation and storage machine called Proyten energy storage. The machine, according to the manufacturerâ€™s sole representative in Africa, Mr Spiros Eswludes, was developed to help provide electricity in rural areas. He said the machine could be used as a source of power for villages either through grid or off the grid. Eswludes, who explained this during the presentation in Lagos, stressed that the machine generates power via solar and wind with lithium batteries that would be charged through the built-in charger. He said the machine can be used to power cellphones, small size refrigerators and computers. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
