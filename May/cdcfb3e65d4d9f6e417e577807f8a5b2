Lagos – Selling food is one business that many people engage in because there are always people to buy because they must eat. One of the people who have taken to selling food to beat the economic difficulties in the country and make money for their family is Prince Peter, who sells food at Ogba in Lagos State. He told DAILY INDEPENDENT that he sells different food items like rice, beans, garri, crayfish and some other cooking items. He added that he also does wholesales. On how he began the business, he said: “I started this business 2014 with the help of my family members; I used N60,000 to start this business and before I came here I had another shop at Agege before moving to Ogba.” Peter sated that he had financial problems in in the days of the business because there were many foodstuff sellers in the area and he did not have enough patronage because most the other food sellers in the area sold their things cheaper so that people would patronise them. On getting support from family members, he said, “Yes, my family was very supportive of my business and most they usually come to help me to sell to my customers when I am not around or when I travel.” He told DAILY INDEPENDENT business helped him in so many ways, “it has helped me to send my children to school, I have also been able to pay bills and importantly it helps me to feed my family and myself.” Peter said that he hoped to expand and grow the business into a big one, adding that and he wants to have shops in different parts of the country and become an employer of labour. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
