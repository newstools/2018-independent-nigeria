ASABA – In a deft move to check the possibility of parallel Local Government Congresses, the All Progressives Congress (APC), Delta State chapter, on Saturday adopted a ‘unity list’ of delegates. This came on the backdrop of controversy which trailed the party’s ward congress in the state. SUNDAY INDEPENDENT gathered that Chief Great Ogboru and Senator Ovie Omo-Agege’s camps were allegedly plotting to hold a parallel congress in the 25 LG before the harmonisation.
