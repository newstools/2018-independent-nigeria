Kirsty Gallacher is walking away from Sky Sports after 20 years. The presenter made the surprising announcement on Friday (May 25) that she was leaving the Rupert Murdoch-owned channel to pursue new career opportunities. “I have had 20 wonderful years at Sky and will leave with the best memories,” she said in a statement. “I am excited to start a new chapter.” The former Strictly Come Dancing contestant has been a member of the Sky Sports team, on-and-off, since 1998, when she first started presenting Sky Sports News. Gallacher took breaks from Sky over the years to film popular shows for other channels, most famously the Ant v Dec segment on Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway for ITV, Channel 4’s breakfast show RI:SE and her BBC Radio 5 Live show Kirsty and Phil. Her long relationship with Sky also extended to presenting entertainment shows, including a five-year run fronting Kirsty’s Home Videos from 2000 to 2005 on Sky One. Over the years, she’s also collaborated with Sky on the modern reboot of Gladiators and anchored news coverage of some of the biggest breaking news events in sports. A statement from Sky Sports on Friday night read: “Having been part of Sky’s story on and off since 1998, Kirsty has decided it is the right time to do something fresh and new and everyone at Sky will miss her greatly. “She played an important role in Sky Sports News establishing its position as the home of breaking news for sport and we wish her every success in the future.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
