The accident happened on a single-track section of railway between Ceske Budejovice, the capital of the South Bohemian Region, and the Bohemian Forest community of Cerny Kriz, according to Czech television reports, quoting the emergency services. Initial investigations suggest one of the drivers ran through a red signal. A total of about 50 people were on board the trains, reports said, including several nursery school children on an excursion. About 300,000 dollars worth of damage is thought to have been caused. The section of railway is popular with tourists visiting the Bohemian Forest National Park. Since December, it has been run by the private railway company GW Train Regio. 0 comments
