Lafia – Again, no fewer than 31 Bassa people have been reported killed by Egbura militias in the on-going crisis between Bassa communities and Egbura communities in Toto Local Government Area of Nasarawa State. Over 50 persons are also reported missing in Bassa communities while several were wounded. The national president of Bassa socio-cultural development, Yusuf Wodi, who disclosed this in a press conference in Lafia, on Tuesday, said the Egbura militias were colluding with the military to launch attacks on Bassa communities in the state. The president said since over two weeks that the crisis began in Toto, Egbura had constantly attacked Bassa communities with their hired mercenaries who parade themselves in military uniforms. Wodi said: “We want to tell the whole world about the reign of terror and massacre unleashed on the Bassa people in the on-going war in Toto Local Government Area of Nasarawa State over which government and other relevant bodies remain mute. “Most Bassa communities have been invaded and completely razed down by the Egbura, using these men in military uniforms. “We note with concern that military men who were supposed to keep the peace are now taking sides by chasing, shooting, and killing our people in their settlements and allowing the Egbura a field day”. He called on the government to deploy unbiased security personnel to Toto to dismantle roadblocks created by the Egbura militias and stop the incessant attack on Bassa and guarantee free movement to all and sundry. The Bassa national president called on Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura of Nasarawa State to visit Toto Local Government Area and invite the two warring parties for a dialogue. He also asked for the setting up of IDPs’ camps in the area to accommodate refugees. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
