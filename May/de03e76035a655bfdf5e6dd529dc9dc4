Lagos – Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles Technical Adviser, is growing grey hairs over the choice of 23 players for the summer World Cup in Russia. Inside sources reveal on Tuesday that the coach’s problem hinged on who to choose among the array of available players. According to our source, the coach has quality options to choose from in every position, revealing further that Rohr’s problem “is who to choose.” The defence, we learnt, is not short of options. “There is Shehu Abdullahi, Ola Aina, Tyron Ebuehi, Bryan Idowu and also Elderson Echiejile. Except Echiejile, the others are young and can play with both legs. But Echiejile has experience. He has to fight for a shirt. “In central defence, aside Leon Balogun and William Troost-Ekong, there is Kenneth Omeruo and Chigozie Awazie. The midfield is the team’s strongest point. There is Mikel Obi, Ogenyi Onazi, Wilfred Ndidi, Oghenekaro Etebor and John Ogu. “The forward is also not lacking in quality players,” said the source. “There is Victor Moses, Odion Ighalo, Ahmed Musa, Moses Simon, Alex Iwobi and Kelechi Iheanacho. It is only in the goalkeeping department that there is headache. “We will know the first choice goalkeeper when the last phase of camping resumes. As it stands, there is no number one goalkeeper. The coach is trying to expose Francis Uzoho. We know what other goalkeepers in the team are capable of. I can confirm to you that we don’t have a first choice goalkeeper yet.” With several of the players recovering from injury, Rohr’s problem is how to ensure that they avoid further injuries before the World Cup kicks off in June. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
