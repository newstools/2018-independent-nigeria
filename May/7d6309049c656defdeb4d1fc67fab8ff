Ahmed Darbi, a former prisoner in the U.S.-run Guantanamo Bay detention camp, returned to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, a representative of the country’s security forces said Thursday. The representative said Darby will be placed into the custody of the centre run by Prince Muhammad bin Nayef. Al-Darbi pleaded guilty in 2014 to the 2002 bomb attack on an oil tanker in the waters off Yemen. The transfer was announced by the Pentagon in a statement on Wednesday. It is the first time under Donald Trump’s presidency that a detainee has left the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, and leaves 40 prisoners there. Under a plea deal, Darbi agreed not to sue the U.S. over his capture and the conditions of his confinement. In 2017,  U.S. military judges sentenced Darbi to 13 years’ detention at the controversial Guantanamo Bay camp after he was found guilty of terrorism. Darbi, who was taken to the U.S. prison in Cuba in August 2002, pleaded guilty to five charges related to the 2002 bombing of the MV Limburg, which killed one crew member and injured 12. Trump has vowed to send more detainees to Guantanamo Bay, which is located on a U.S. naval base on Cuba. 0 comments
