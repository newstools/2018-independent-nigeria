A Thai court on Tuesday sentenced a German man to three months in prison for cracking a  bomb joke at a Bangkok airport in February. The 70-year-old was found guilty of violating an aviation regulation after shouting “boom” at a flight attendant as he was putting his bag in the overhead compartment in the plane before takeoff at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi International Airport. He told police that he was a bit drunk and that he intended the remark to be funny. “His sentence was halved from six months due to his confession, a typical practice in the Thai judicial system. “He was also given a one-year suspension before his sentence goes into effect, so he will not serve jail time this year,’’ the official added. Report says a maximum penalty for the crime is five years imprisonment. Another German man was arrested at an airport in northern Thailand in late April after saying he had a bomb in his luggage as he was upset by his flight delay; however officials found no explosives on board. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
