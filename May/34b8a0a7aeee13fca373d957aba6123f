Henry Onyekuru might not feature for Anderlecht again this season for unfitness reason  contrary to reports that the striker is fit. It was also wrongly reported that the player was included in the match day squad for the Belgian champions last weekend despite Anderlecht axing him from the 18, and the fact that he had to watch the game against Club Brugge from the stands. However, the Anderlecht manager, is optimistic that Henry would be fit for the World Cup and it’s up to Gernot Rohr to name him in the Super Eagles 23-man squad list. On the fitness status of Henry and Senegal defender Kara Mbodji, Hein Vanhaezebrouck was quoted as saying by Het Nieuwsblad :  ”We evaluate their situation daily, but those injuries were pretty serious and so the recovery requires some time. ”Playing for Anderlecht may not be feasible this season, but being fit for the World Cup is possible. That also applies to Onyekuru.” Henry has made only one appearance for the Super Eagles, against Togo in an international friendly last June in which he lasted 32 minutes on the Stade des Diablots turf. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
