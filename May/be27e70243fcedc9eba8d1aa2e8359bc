Lagos – Imohimi Edgal, the Commissioner of Police (CP), Lagos State, has assured Mrs. Olayinka Adeyemi, the director, Office of Public Defender (OPD), of his readiness to collaborate with her office to reduce to the barest minimum the issue of domestic, sexual violence and all sorts of abuses in the state. Edgal gave the assurance when the director paid him a courtesy visit in his office in Ikeja. The CP said there was no better way to rid the state of crime than through collaborations. “If you look at the society now very critically, the Office of the Public Defender is perhaps one of the most important offices, because we are not only talking about fighting violence/crimes but building a safe society. When issues that relate to the rights of the citizens are not taken care of, the society cannot thrive. “I know that OPD has a vital role to play in the area of fight against gander, sexual and other abuses; that is why since I was appointed the Commissioner of Police I have been working very closely with your office, so that the synergy would be deepened,” he said. Mrs. Adeyemi said the courtesy visit was aimed at collaborating with relevant stakeholders like Nigeria Police Force in carrying out the mandate of the office effectively and efficiently. She stated that OPD was not only happy to partner with the Commissioner of Police, but eager to work as a team to effectively reduce to the barest minimum the issues of domestic, sexual violence and all sorts of abuses in the state. She also reiterated the fact that the state government has zero tolerance for domestic, sexual and other forms of violence. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
