Super Eagles technical adviser, Gernot Rohr is not losing sleep over the hamstring injury picked up by Leicester City midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi and Alex Iwobi of Arsenal as he believes that the players would recover in time to make his World Cup squad. Ndidi sustained the harmstring injury on Saturday in their 5-0 loss to Crystal Placace, while Iwobi copped his on Sunday in Arsenal’s 2-1 loss to Manchester United. While Leicester boss, Clause Puel has resorted to prayers in support of Ndidi, Super Eagles’ media officer, Toyin Ibitoye says Rohr is not losing sleep over the matter. “I hope it is not a serious injury for Ndidi and I hope he can play in the World Cup, all the scenarios today (Saturday) were bad for us. We will see,” Puel said on on Sunday. “It is a hamstring injury. I hope it is not serious of course because it is an important moment.” Ibitoye, however, explained that Rohr would have been informed officially by The Foxes had Ndidi being in doubt of making it to the World Cup and, since the coach has not received any call to that effect, he would not worry about the player’s chances of making it to Russia 2018. Ibitoye’s revelation came soon after reports emerged that Ndidi went for a scan after sustaining the injury and is now awaiting results of the medical examination. Addition reports also claimed The Foxes medical team contacted Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to inform them that the player would be fit before the start of the World Cup. An official disclosed: “Ndidi suffered a hamstring injury; he had done a scan and is waiting for feedback from the doctors. “The focus is on how to get him ready for the World Cup, Leicester City say they are going to do their best. He is very determined to play at the World Cup. “The Leicester City physiotherapist is in touch with the NFF and informed them that he will be fit before the start of the World Cup.” 0 comments
