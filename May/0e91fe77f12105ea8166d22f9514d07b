The Sports Minister, Solomon Dalung, has instructed the Nigeria Football Federation to shelve all plans for elections into the next board and concentrate on the summer World Cup in Russia. Dalung, who said this in Port Harcourt after the Super Eagles were held to a 1-1 by DR Congo in a farewell/ friendly game, noted that preparation for the board election might derail World Cup programmes. “The NFF should put everything concerning elections and electoral committees on hold and concentrate on the World Cup preparation which is more important to the country. “The country has invested so much right from the campaign for a ticket till date so we cannot afford any distractions in the name of elections. “The World Cup and elections cannot be pursued concurrently therefore all issues on the next elections into the NFF board should be suspended pending the outcome of legal advice from the Attorney- General on the decision of the Supreme Court on the current crisis in the Federation.” Dalung called the attention of the Federation to the Supreme Court’s verdict and warned that calling for elections without legal advice from the Attorney-General would further generate confusion and distraction. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
