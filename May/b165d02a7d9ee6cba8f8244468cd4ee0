Lagos – Coach Gernot Rohr will be glad as Everton loanee, Henry Onyekuru, who was injured and sidelined for a long time, is returning to full fitness after starring for 60 minutes in Anderlecht reserve’s 2-2 draw against Standard Liege in a reserve professional league. Onyekuru had earlier played for 30 minutes against Sporting Lokeren last week, making him to start the match against Standard Liege, where he showed huge signs of recovery and lasted for about 60 minutes. Consequently, the Super Eagles star may likely be on the roaster for his club’s next league match at the weekend and that will be his first competitive match for Anderlecht in 2018. Anderlecht first-team coach, Hein Vanhaezebrouck’s left wing options in his preferred 3-4-3 formation are thin, with Ivan Obradovic battling to overcome an injury and Kenny Saief suspended for the game. Onyekuru was deployed as a left winger several times in the first half of the season but was often criticized by the coach for not pulling his weight but his goals tell another story. Rohr has a big decision to make, whether to include Onyekuru on a 35-man provisional roster for the World Cup and monitor his fitness at the training camp or entirely leave him out of the squad which won’t be a controversial decision. The 20-year-old is a bit part player for the Super Eagles, having made only one appearance to date which came against Togo eleven months ago. 0 comments
