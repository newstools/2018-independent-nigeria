Ado-Ekiti – Bishop Felix Ajakaiye of Ekiti Catholic Diocese has admonished journalists to shun fake news and promote peace in the country. According to the Catholic cleric, fake news is destructive, hence newsmen should promote news that are true and would make the society to develop. He gave the charge at the 2018 World Communications Day held at St. Joseph’s Catholic Cathedral, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State capital, with the theme, ‘The Truth Will Set You Free’. “Fake news is just like Ebola,” which will not lead us to anywhere, he said, adding that “Nigeria is heading towards ruin, if we do not come together as one and as a country.” He charge media professionals not to promote what he described as “one chance journalism”, but do follow up stories to help themselves and the nation. “For us to overcome fake news, we need to overcome what we don’t want other people to do to us, so that we can all stay together as brothers and sisters.” He enumerated the four sins of the media, which include misinformation, defamation, calumny and god-fatherism. Charging the people and the politicians not to promote money politics, Ajakaye noted that they could not get the nation to the right path. “Don’t sell your conscience; be good in your words and your deeds.” In message entitled ‘The truth will set you free’ Pope Francis had invited everyone to promote a journalism of peace. The Pope added that “peace is the true news, “that is why ensuring the accuracy of sources and protecting communication are real means of promoting goodness, generating trust, and opening the way to communion and peace.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
