Lagos – FIBA, has ended the leadership crisis rocking the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF). FIBA, in a two-page letter dated May 28, 2018 and signed by its Secretary General, Patrick Baumann, stated that Musa Kida led board should administer the sport in the country. “In the meantime, and as indicated in FIBA’s letter of 26 July 2017, FIBA will continue to communicate soley with Mr Kida and the Board elected on 13 June 2016 as representatives of the NBBF and as the management recognized by the Nigeria Olympic Committee. Consequently, until such time as there are new elections, Mr Kida and his board shall organise all espects (including sporting and commercial) of Nigerian basketball’s international representation,” FIBA stated. The world basketball ruling body noted that a new election could not hold until new NBBF statutes revised and approved by it. “Before elections are contemplated, the revision and consequent acceptance by FIBA of the new NBBF Statutes, pursuant to which new elections shall be held, must be accomplished.” It stated that “the process of revising the NBBF Statutes shall be under its direction. During the revision process, FIBA will consult with both parties and other stakeholder in Nigerian basketball.” As part of its action plan, deadline for consultation with relevant stakeholders is 30 July, 2018 with the first revision of the Statutes to hold latrest by 31 August 2018. Consultation with relevant stakeholders is slated for 14 Septemer 2018 with the final revision and approval by FIBA slated for 15 October 2018. It is after this that a new date for the elections will be announced. FIBA therefore requested Kida and Tijjani Umar to send to it their own version of statutes with them by June 4 2018 at the latest. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
