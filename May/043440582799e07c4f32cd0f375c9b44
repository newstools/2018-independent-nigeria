Paris Saint-Germain plan to offer 40-year-old Gianluigi Buffon a four-year contract, reports La Repubblica. The legendary goalkeeper has departed Juventus but is expected to continue his playing career, with reported interest in England as well as France. Despite his age, PSG are offering the goalkeeper a four-year deal in the hopes of keeping him on as an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup – taking place in PSG ownership’s home country of Qatar – whenever he chooses to end his playing career. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
