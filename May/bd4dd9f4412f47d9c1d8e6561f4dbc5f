Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has challenged former President Olusegun Obasanjo and his political coalition to show the Nigerian public their presidential candidate. Reacting to Obasanjo’s announcement on the transformation of his political movement into a political party, the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Bello said the APC is well prepared to slug it out with the new party in the 2019 general elections. Bello’s challenge on Obasanjo was made at a stakeholders’ forum held in Lokoja shortly before the commencement of Saturday’s APC local council congresses. He said: “Let us see who they will present to contest against President Muhammadu Buhari, our God-given leader, whom US President Donald Trump, even referred to as Sir.” According to the governor, the defeat of 2015 would be a child’s play compared to what the opposition would get in 2019. “We are going to retire these old and bad politicians in 2019. It is just like the President said, ‘if we don’t kill corruption, corruption will kill Nigeria.’ So also, if we don’t retire these old and bad politicians, good politicians will be sent away. Also, Hon. Bestman Nze-Jumbo, the Kogi State APC Congress Committee chairmen, also warned party members allegedly trying to factionalise the party to have a rethink. He added that any party member trying to factionalise APC in a bid to frustrate its fortunes in 2019 would get a rude shock. 4 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
