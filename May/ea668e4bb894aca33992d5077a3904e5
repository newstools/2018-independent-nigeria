President Sergio Mattarella summoned Carlo Cottarelli, a former senior director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), for talks on Monday, his office said in a statement â€“ a move that suggested he may ask him to head a technocrat government. Earlier on Sunday, Mattarella effectively scuttled efforts to form a coalition government supported by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far-right League after he rejected their choice for economy minister. Most political parties have said they would not back a technocrat government in parliament and would push for early elections in the autumn if a coalition administration failed to take office. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
