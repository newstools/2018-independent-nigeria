Lagos – Super Eagles players currently preparing at the Le Meridien Hotel in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, are looking beyond Monday’s friendly match against DR Congo. This is according to Toyin Ibitoye, the team’s media officer. Ibitoye spoke to DAILY INDEPENDENT on Thursday, saying that the players were united in their actions, trainings and discussions and were looking at the bigger picture, which is the World Cup in Russia. The national team’s image maker, while acknowledging that Captain Mikel Obi had been in constant contact with Coach Gernot Rohr on why he was yet to arrive the team’s camp, said that the players have vowed to represent Nigeria well in Russia. “My brother, but one or two players yet to arrive, we have a full house; in fact we have about 95 percent of them right here and the spirit is very high. The players are very optimistic and have vowed to represent us (Nigeria) well. “They are like friends and discuss everything concerning the World Cup. To them, the friendly matches are not the main things but they are preparing hard to ensure that they do well in Russia. Mikel has been in constant touch with the coach and will join the team soon,” Ibitoye said on Thursday. The Super Eagles will play England after the DR Congo game before they round up preparations with a date against their Czech Republic counterparts. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
