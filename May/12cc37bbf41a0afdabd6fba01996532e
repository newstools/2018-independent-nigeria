Warri – The Olu of Warri, Ogiame Ikenwoli, has pleaded with the Guinness Nigeria Limited to establish factory in the oil city, stressing that there is peace and harmony in Niger Delta. According to him, the area has been enjoying enduring peace for quite some time, adding that NigerDelta is suitable for investors. Ogiame made the appeal when Guinness Nigeria Limited led by its chairman Board of Directors, Mr. Babatunde Savage, visited him at the weekend. The monarch decried lack of job opportunities for the youths, adding, that peace is guaranteed when the youths are gainfully employed. “I can assure you that there is abundant peace in the region because everybody now sleeps with their eyes closed. Youth restiveness has been a thing of the past; all what we are after now is for our jobless youths to be gainfully employed”, explained the Warri monarch and lauded the effort of the company’s hierarchy for maintaining enviable record it has achieved over the years. Earlier, Savage commended the Warri monarch for the peaceful manner he has been ruling his people and also ensuring that there is peace between the Itsekiris and her neighbours. The Chairman remarked that the company’s hierarchy decided to visit the king and also to introduce the company’s new product, known as Royal Kingdom Premier lager beer. The Chairman noted that Guinness is everywhere in the world and it also produces Gordon Gin, beside, “We are the biggest producers of spirit worldwide,” he said. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
