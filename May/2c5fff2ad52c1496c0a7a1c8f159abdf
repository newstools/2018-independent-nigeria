Spanish giants FC Barcelona are expected to touch down in South Africa on Tuesday ahead of their international club friendly against Mamelodi Sundowns. Barca officially announced they will be playing Sundowns in South Africa next week, with the FNB Stadium hosting the clash on Wednesday. World footballing icons such as Lionel Messi and Andrea Iniesta are expected to be part of the contingent heading to Johannesburg for the much-anticipated match. La Liga Africa director Antonio Barradas has confirmed to KickOff.com that Barcelona will be arriving in South Africa on Tuesday, 24 hours before their match against Sundowns. “They [Barcelona] will connect a flight direct from Barcelona to OR Tambo (airport),” Barradas tells this website. “I am not sure about the time (Barca will be arriving South Africa).” Meanwhile, Barradas says LaLiga is excited about the prospect of Barcelona coming to South Africa to play against the Brazilians. “This will be great to bring the greatest team in the world, Barcelona, champions of Spain, will play against champions of South Africa, specifically for our father Nelson Mandela, who if he was still alive, would be turning 100 years old. “This would be the greatest achievement to bring Barcelona to play this game, especially to give back to young children of South Africa,” he adds. Barradas also revealed the friendly game will be televised in 170 countries across the world. “It will be transmitted worldwide. Laliga will transmit it around the world, 170 countries. I think it will be a fantastic event for South Africa and Barcelona,” he concludes. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
