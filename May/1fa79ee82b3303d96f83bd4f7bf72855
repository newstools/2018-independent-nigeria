Fresh from reaching a first Champions League final for 11 years, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp described Sunday’s visit to Chelsea as “another Champions League semifinal” with their participation in next season’s competition still not certain. Victory in any of Liverpool’s three remaining games of the season at Stamford Bridge, home to Brighton on the final day of the Premier League season or against the might of Real Madrid in the Champions League final will secure qualification. But for Klopp’s peace of mind and to rest a tiring squad with a growing injury list, getting the job done by securing at least a point this weekend is the ideal scenario. “Do we have the widest squad in world football in the moment? No, we don’t have it,” said Klopp. “That this group go to the final is exceptional. We get all the knocks over the season, all the injuries in the wrong moments and we still have to carry on.” Liverpool’s European exploits have undoubtedly hampered what seemed a comfortable path to a top-four finish just a few weeks ago. Three draws in their past four league outings with Everton, West Brom and Stoke as Klopp prioritised Champions League progress have allowed fifth-placed Chelsea to close to within six points of the Anfield club. The Londoners also have three games remaining to Liverpool’s two, meaning if Antonio Conte’s deposed champions win their remaining fixtures they will, at worst, finish level on points with the Champions League finalists. However, Liverpool’s far superior goal difference means just a point on Sunday or victory against Brighton should suffice. “It’s not like we can say now we are qualified for the Champions League. Chelsea at the weekend is an unbelievably important game for us,” added Klopp. 0 comments
