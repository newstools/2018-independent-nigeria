Lagos – Coach Gernot Rohr has promised a better performance from the Super Eagles when they play the England on Saturday in one but the last tune up matches for the team. Rohr was speaking on the backdrop of the team’s 1-1 play against the Leopards of Congo DR in Port Harcourt on Monday, where William Troost-Ekong scored a 15th minute goal to put Nigeria ahead. Speaking through Toyin Ibitoye, the team’s media officer, the coach noted that the friendly was a good test for the team, saying that the Congolese, who were rated above the Super Eagles, showed so much resilience to hold Nigeria. “The coach was happy with the performance and the team generally because he used the match to test a lot of players and some options. It was a good game,” Ibitoye quoted Rohr as saying. “We have another match against England and we are expected to have the full complement of all players so Nigerians should expect a better and improved performance from these players,” the coach said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
