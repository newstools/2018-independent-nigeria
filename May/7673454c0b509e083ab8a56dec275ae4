U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said trade negotiations are still underway with China and to “stay tuned”. “Trade negotiations are continuing with China. “They have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the U.S., for many years. Stay tuned!’’ Trump said in a Twitter message. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said State Council Vice Premier, Liu He, would arrive in the U.S. on Tuesday for trade negotiations. The first round of trade talks between China and the U.S. took place in Beijing on May 3 to 4. The two delegations addressed issues relating to expanding U.S. exports to China, bilateral trade in services, bilateral investments, intellectual property protection and tariffs. According to the Chinese media, a consensus was reached in some of these areas, but major disagreements still remained. Tensions between China and the United States have escalated in recent months. In March, Washington introduced a 25 per cent tariff on imported steel and a 10-per cent tariff on imported aluminium. Also in April, Trump threatened to introduce extra tariffs on the Chinese imports worth about 150 billion dollars per year. In retaliation, China announced its decision to impose 25 per cent tariffs on a total of 106 goods imported from the U.S. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
