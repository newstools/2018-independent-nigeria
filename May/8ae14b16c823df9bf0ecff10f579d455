Former Corporate Czars and top board room administrators have canvassed for a policy change that will give Nigerians equal access to multinational companiesâ€™ board membership just as their foreign national counterparts. They also urged state governments to complement the efforts of the Federal Government by insisting that multinationals doing business in their respective states develop capable Nigerians to the level of Chief Executives in their organisations, warning that failure to comply should lead to halting of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from such discriminatory companies.
