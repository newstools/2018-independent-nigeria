The Super Eagles pre-World Cup training camp opened in Uyo on Monday morning and Arsenal forward Alex Iwobi is the latest player to hit the Ibom Meridian Hotel Camp thereby bringing to five the number of players in Camp.
Iwobi joined Vice-captain Ogenyi Onazi, Ikechukwu Ezenwa, Ola Aina and Bursaspor of Turkey defender William Troost-Ekong as early arrivals.
Meanwhile, Kenneth Omeruo has assured Nigerians that the World Cup trophy was within the reach of the team should Nigeria starts the campaign against Croatia on a positive note.
He said that the team has come of age and can be counted among real contenders.
“Everywhere you go, people talk about Messi, Modric, Aguero and Rakitic but nobody is talking of the components that made the present crops of Super Eagles players the first team from Africa to pick group ticket to Russia 2018 World Cup.
“I think it is a huge advantage for us to be underrated but we are a determined side to give our best at the World Cup. Nigeria will hug global limelight after the qualifying group stage matches and all through to the last phase of the tournament in Russia,” Omeruo assured. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
