A hunter was fatally shot during an overnight hunt with her partner in a forest in north-western Bavaria. The 47-year-old woman was with her partner in a forest in the district of Miltenberg when the shot rang out, police and Aschaffenburg prosecutors said Wednesday in a statement. “We are working from the assumption that he fired a shot,’’ a police spokesman said. The woman died at the scene. Her companion was interrogated “in order to clarify whether we are dealing with an accident or whether criminal conduct is at hand,’’ the spokesperson said. Specialists from the Bavarian State Office for Criminal Investigation have been called in for the investigation. 0 comments
