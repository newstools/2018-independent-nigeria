Health officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Friday said they are working hard to get out accurate information about the Ebola Virus Disease, the deadly hemorrhagic fever, but face fear and suspicion. “A doctor and a nursing sister were threatened by locals after they were accused of bringing the disease to their communities, while people in one town prevented medics from testing the body of someone suspected to have died from Ebola,” officials said. “The information campaign is being put in place but is still insufficient,” Medecins Sans Frontieres’ (MSF) emergency medical coordinator Jean-Clement Cabrol told newsmen in Geneva. “Religious and traditional leaders in communities are not being used enough,” he said. Since April, the disease is thought to have killed at least 22 people and infected 30 more. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
