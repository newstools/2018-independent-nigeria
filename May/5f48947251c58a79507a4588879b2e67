The Bible Society of Nigeria (BSN) has urged Nigerians to offer intensive prayers to God on behalf of the nation and the forth coming elections. Rev. Dare Ajiboye, General Secretary of BSN made the appeal while intimating the press of the annual Bible week, “God Is Our Refuge And Strength, A Very Present Help In Trouble,” starting tomorrow, May 7th to end next Sunday, May 13th. Ajiboye, in a statement made available to SUNDAY INDEPENDENT through Mr. Benjamin Mordi, Manager, Media and Programmes said that: “Bible week celebration is organised annually to raise consciousness for Bible work in Nigeria, offer prayers and as well raise funds to support the Bible translation, publishing and distribution efforts of The Bible Society of Nigeria.” He added that the Bible week which is a celebration for all users of the Bible across the country will feature lectures, Bible quiz, debates, exchange of pulpit and prayers among other programmes. BSN, he reiterated is “a not-for-profit-making interdenominational Christian organisation that translates the Bible into Nigerian languages, publishes, distributes and raises funds for the Bible work.” So far, he said BSN has completed Bible in 26 Nigerian languages. Calling for support towards the propagation of the gospel, Ajiboye stated thus: “Bible translation/revision is ongoing in nine different Nigerian languages. It costs the organisation a minimum of 40 million to complete a Bible translation project.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
