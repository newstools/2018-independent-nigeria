Lagos – Enyimba head coach, Paul Aigbogun, has assured Nigerians that his team will bounce to reckoning after the ‘disappointing’ 0-3 loss to CARA Brazzaville in Congo in the ongoing Confederation of African Football (CAF) Confederation Cup. Aigbogun believes that his team’s “poor” conversion rate in the fixture resulted in their defeat despite a decent display.
The former Warri Wolves manager said it was not time to overreact in an alarming way as the two-time African champions still stand a chance of progressing out of their group despite the defeat in Congo.
He has also played down suggestions of a possible adjustment of his playing personnel, especially the starters, explaining that it was a first defeat for the club in the competition in six matches.
“The beautiful thing about the group stage is that it is a (mini) league and not like a knockout (format) where we would have needed to go back and work on scoring four goals, or three.
“We took three points from the first game, the other team went away and didn’t take any point but took the points in this game, so we go home and hope we take the points in our next game.
“It is our first defeat in five or six games in this competition, so you don’t make changes after one game.
Enyimba’s next Confederation Cup game is in July against Ivorian club Williamsville AC who currently top Group C with four points. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
