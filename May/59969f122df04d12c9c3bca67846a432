Lagos – The Nigeria bourse recorded a bearish performance last week as sustained profit taking in the market bellwethers dragged the benchmark index down on four of the five trading sessions. The All Share Index (ASI) slid 0.5 per cent week-on-week to settle at 40,022.31 points, while Year-to-date return weakened to 7.3 per cent. Correspondingly, investors lost N71.1 billion in value as market capitalisation reduced to N14.9 trillion. The negative performance, according to analysts at Afrinvest, was largely attributable to profit taking in bellwethers – Dangote Cement (-0.2%), Nigerian Breweries (-3.5%) and Guaranty Trust Bank (-2.3%). Moreover, activity level weakened as average volume and value traded dipped 4.7 per cent and 0.2 per cent to 317.1m units and N5.2 billion respectively. The top traded stocks by volume last week were First City Monument Bank (310.0m), Guaranty Trust Bank (246.2m) and Zenith Bank (136.3m) while Guaranty Trust Bank (N11.2bn), Zenith Bank (N3.7bn) and First City Monument Bank (N777.3m) were the week’s top traded stocks by value. The trading week started on a negative note, reversing gains from the preceding Friday as the ASI shed 0.11 per cent. The bearish performance was sustained in four consecutive trading sessions with the benchmark index sliding 0.4 per cent, 0.18 per cent and 0.40 per cent on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday respectively. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
