Umuahia – Against recent poor ratings of the three years administration of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu by the opposition in Abia State, John Kalu, the Commissioner for Information, says the opposition are strangers in their own state. The commissioner, in a chat with the DAILY INDEPENDENT, described the opposition in the state as propagandists who see nothing than blind critic. “It is either that the opposition we have cannot see or that the may be living outside Abia State, that is why they are saying that he has done nothing. “Please ask the opposition whether the picture of Faulks Road they shared on Facebook before this administration came is the same picture of Faulks Road as at today. The new pictures of Kamalu, Ehere, Umuatako and MCC by Samek Road are not the same pictures they had shown before. “This administration has completed 68 road projects in 33 months. If that is nothing, then what would be something to them?” According to him, 79 road projects are ongoing. “Most of them have reached between 70 to 90 per cent completion. We believe that by May 29, eight new roads will be commissioned. “There are 180 completed classroom blocks. Four model schools are under construction. The governor is implementing One Ward one Project Initiative. “One opposition leader was quoted as saying that the truth must be told that the state of road infrastructure has improved now. If other people are unable to see what Governor Ikpeazu is doing in Abia State, it is simply because they are not living in Aba.” 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
