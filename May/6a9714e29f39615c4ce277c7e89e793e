Lagos – Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles Technical Adviser, on Tuesday dropped five players out of the 30-man provisional list released earlier in the month. And the biggest of the five is Chippa United goalkeeper, Daniel Akpeyi, injured Moses Simon, who plays for Gent FC, Chidozie Awaziem, Kano Pillars Junior Lokosa and Stephen Eze. It is believed that Plateau United goalkeeper, Dele Ajiboye, has shone in training. Speaking earlier on Moses injury, Rohr said, “It is unfortunate that [Moses] Simon won’t be able to make it to the World Cup because of his injury. “The test we conducted on him showed that he would need at least three or four weeks more to recover from the injury he is having. “It is a sad day for us but there is nothing we can do about it because we must move forward. “He is an important member of our squad because he took an active part in the qualifiers but this injury has come at the wrong time. “We are however confident that those remaining will be able to carry on without him.” However, the coach has announced that ailing Carl Ikeme will be included in the team for the World Cup as the unregistered 24th player. 25 players will leave for London on Wednesday with two players remaining to be dropped. The coach will name his 23-man squad on June 4, two days after the friendly against England at the Wembley. Meanwhile, Super Eagles will leave for London today ahead of their friendly match against England on Saturday. The team would have left for the UK on Tuesday but the Nigeria Football Federation organised a seminar on wealth creation, investment opportunities and portfolio management, which took place at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja yesterday. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
