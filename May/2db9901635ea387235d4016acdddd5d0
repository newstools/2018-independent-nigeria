ASABA – Izu Anioma, the apex Anioma socio-political organisation, has warned indigenes nursing governorship ambition to drop it and support Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, the Delta State governor’s ambition for a second term. It affirmed that Okowa remained the sole candidate of Anioma people for the governorship election in 2019. Hon. Kingsley Ojie, the chairman of the interim national executive of Izu Anioma, in a chat with SUNDAY INDEPENDENT in Asaba, said, “For the fact that those aspiring for governorship seat were unable to contest against or defeat Okowa in 2015, we will not allow them this time to act as distractions to this political equation that must see us complete our two terms of office as a people.” He lauded Okowa’s performance in the last three years, saying he had done exceedingly well and deserved a second term, stressing that the other two senatorial districts, Delta Central and South had had their two terms respectively. He said it was imperative for every zone to now be on the same page to ensure that Okowa completed the two-term mandate for people of Anioma extraction as had been unconventionally worked out politically. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
