Lagos – Toyin Ibitoye, the Super Eagles media officer, has revealed that there would be no surprises when the 30-man Super Eagles provisional list for the World Cup is released by Coach Gernot Rohr. Ibitoye, who spoke to DAILY INDEPEPENDENT on Wednesday, noted that Rohr was very careful not to distort the chemistry among the players, but said that in the event of an injury, the coach would still consider other options. “The list will be out very soon but I will tell you that there will be no surprise as Coach Rohr is very much interested in continuing with the existing chemistry in the team. “You know at this time, it will be dangerous to start experimenting and the coach, an experienced one, knows the importance of continued unity in the team. There may be surprises if we have injuries but we are not praying for that,” he said. With less than 40 days to go for the World Cup, Nigerians are eagerly awaiting the provisional list. Nigeria takes on Croatia on June 16 before they play Iceland and Argentina to round up the group phase of the Mundial. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
