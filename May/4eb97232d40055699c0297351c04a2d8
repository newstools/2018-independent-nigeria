South Korea’s Finance Minister, Kim Dong-yeon, said on Wednesday the country would limit General Motors’ right to sell shares and assets in its South Korean unit. This is so to ensure that the U.S. automaker is kept from leaving the nation for at least 10 years. Last month, GM and South Korea reached a preliminary deal to inject 4.35 billion dollars into the loss-making unit to keep it afloat. The U.S. automaker has announced plans to close one of its four South Korean plants and cut headcount by almost 3,000 workers. “We will limit GM’s rights to sell a stake in GM Korea and regain the Korea Development Bank’s veto rights,’’ Dong-yeon said in a radio interview. The U.S. automaker owns 77 per cent of GM Korea, while KDB holds 17 per cent and China’s SAIC Motor Corp (600104.SS) controls the remaining six per cent. Under the preliminary deal with GM, the state-run Korean bank will regain veto power that allows it to block the sale of more than 20 per cent of the unit’s assets, KDB official said. “At least 10 years (of GM staying in Korea) will be guaranteed,’’ he said. “We will make sure GM will contribute to the South Korean economy by running normal operations for the long term.’’ Kaher Kazem, CEO of GM Korea, said in an internal letter on Tuesday that it plans to reach a binding, final agreement with the government on Friday. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
