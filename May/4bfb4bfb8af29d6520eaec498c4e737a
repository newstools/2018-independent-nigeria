Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo) delivered a total of 763 million barrels of oil from the Bonga field between first production in 2005 and 2017, while at the same time expanding the field with further drilling of wells in Bonga Phases 2 and 3 through a subsea tie-back that unlocked the nearby Bonga North West field in August 2014, its Managing Director, Bayo Ojulari, has said. He disclosed this weekend in Lagos while reviewing the operation of the company. “The success story at Bonga is not only that it is Nigeria’s first oil and gas production project in more than 1,000 metres of water, or that It increased Nigeria’s oil production capacity by 10% in 2005.The main point is that Bonga is a Nigerian venture delivered by Nigerians using global expertise and processes offered by Shell that have launched Nigeria into the league of notable deep -water players.” Identifying the Bonga turnaround maintenance in March and April 2017 as a significant milestone in SNEPCo’s operations, he said this was the most complex and largest of the three previous turnaround maintenances in the 12-year history of Bonga. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
