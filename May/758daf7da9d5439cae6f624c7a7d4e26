Olumba Olumba Obu, Spiritual Head, Brotherhood of the Cross and Star, has tasked Nigerians on genuine repentance should they desire that the tide turns to their favour. Obu, who was represented by Christ Ambassador Samuel Inok said this at a briefing as part of activities for the 100 years celebration of the Church at the National Headquarters Surulere, Lagos. He said that when Nigerians embrace God, He would intervene in its social, economic, and political challenges of our nation. According to him: “If the nation will turn to God, and turn from their wicked ways, he will heal their land. We have been talking about peace, how can you give peace if you don’t have it? It is only God that have peace and can give peace. “If we confess our sins, we should worship God in spirit and in truth and this is expected to be at all times. Nigerians should turn a new leaf and worship God and not to visit the house of God only; we should not wear God as masquerade. “We should not turn religion into cultism, where people create factions to fight against themselves, it is not what our God said.” On the church’s centenary he said that: “We are here on the mandate of our father to inform the world that our father God the creator of the heavens and earth is on earth in human form, he has been on earth physically for 100 years. “And this year, 30th of December 2018 will mark the 100 years of the physical manifestation of God on earth. This may not be acceptable to many but it does not change the truth.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
