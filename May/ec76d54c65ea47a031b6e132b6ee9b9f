Despite being diagnosed with acute leukaemia, Super Eagles goalkeeper Carl Ikeme is among 59 players retained by Wolverhampton Wanderers ahead of the English Premier League (EPL) season. Wolves got promoted from the Championship at the end of last season despite losing their first choice goalkeeper Ikeme to the disease at the beginning of the season in July. Ikeme is currently undergoing treatment. The retained list was announced by Wolves on their official website on Sunday. The list has been submitted to the English Football League (EFL) as the club prepares for a return to the top flight. On July 6, 2017, it was announced that Ikeme was diagnosed with acute leukaemia after returning abnormal blood tests during a routine pre-season check-up. Also among the retained players are the duo of Bright Enobakhare and Dominic Iorfa. Meanwhile, 12 senior players were not offered new contracts and five youngsters have been released from Wolves scholarship programme. Wolves were crowned champions of the 2017/2018 English Championship, which secured automatic promotion to the Premier League. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
