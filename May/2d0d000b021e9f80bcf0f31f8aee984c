BENIN – Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Saturday averted crisis when it adopted a consensus arrangement to produce its executives at the council level. The party’s leadership led by its state chairman, Anselm Ojezua, had urged members to adopt consensus arrangement for the process or go ahead with an elective congress where necessary. It was, however, learnt that the arrangement was adopted across the 18 local government areas of the state, which finally paid off as the congress went smoothly in almost all the council areas, except in Owan East Local Government, where crisis was reported. Meanwhile, there was a sporadic shooting in and around Owan East Local Government secretariat, Afuze, during the local government congress election as Hon. Jimoh Ijegbai, Commissioner for Local Government and Communities Affairs was barred from entering the complex. The commissioner, who spoke to newsmen, alleged that one Osain Isaiah, a 75-year-old man, was locked inside the room for several hours, while broken bottles were freely used to disperse candidates. 3 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
