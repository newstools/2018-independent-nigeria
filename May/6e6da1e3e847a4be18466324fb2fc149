This week saw two extremely exciting Champions League semi-finals come to a close. Real Madrid were fortunate to get the win over Bayern Munich and in the end Liverpool were also fortunate to beat Roma setting up an intriguing final, Sportbible.com has reported. It’s been one of the oddest and most fun Champions League knock-out stages in a while with Roma’s come back against Barca, Juve’s near comeback against Real, Manchester United’s embarrassment against Sevilla and Liverpool’s demolition of Manchester City’s defence amongst the highlights. Now we’re down to the final two and on Tuesday night most people were saying that Real’s performance was enough to give Liverpool lots of hope but the Reds’ own near collapse led people to change their outlook. Well it seem that everyone else’s opinion doesn’t matter because the Champions League winners have already been decided by UEFA, according to their website Liverpool are this year’s winners:  This really will be one for the conspiracy theorists, especially those who happen to be fans of Los Blancos. Real Madrid fans already love to suggest that the European football governing body should be renamed UEFALONA for their perceived favouring of Barcelona, although they were on the end of some favourable decisions against Bayern themselves. When Mo Salah wins a last minute penalty and Jordan Henderson scores to make it 4-3 to Liverpool from the spot onMay 26th don’t say you weren’t warned! 0 comments
