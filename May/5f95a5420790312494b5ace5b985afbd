Nigeria head coach Gernot Rohr says he is counting on his scouts to give him the lowdown about the Croatian national team. The Super Eagles are in the same group as Croatia at the summer FIFA World Cup which will be hosted by Russia between June and July. ”I can not ask anyone in Croatia to find out about the national team, that’s impossible,” Rohr told Sportske Novosti. ”After all, I also have good people in Nigeria and intelligent scouts that will bring me all the information I need. I do not worry that something will remain a secret.” Nigeria’s Group D also includes Argentina and Iceland, who will clash at the Otkritie Arena in Moscow on the 16th of June 2018. ”There must be some pressure in everything you do in life. It’s important not to be too big or too small, but it’s good that it exists,” the German added. ”We are humble and confident in ourselves; we try not to put an extra burden on our back.” Nigeria and Croatia will open their World Cup campaign at the Kaliningrad Stadium in Kaliningrad on the 16th of June 2018. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
