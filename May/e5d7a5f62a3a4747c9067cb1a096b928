The first book about Evangelist Billy Graham written from the perspective of his son who reportedly knew him best has been unveiled. ‘Through My Father’s Eyes’, written by Graham’s son, Rev. Franklin took about 12 years to be completed and is based on “lifetime of personal memories, anecdotes, and lessons”,  that he has learned from his father. “These are the lessons my father taught me. I am privileged to tell this story. I’ve shared some of the lessons I learned from my father in ‘Through My Father’s Eyes,’ and I hope they will be an encouragement to others. “I am grateful for the legacy I inherited from my parents, but I treasure more their testimonies that have beckoned many to the foot of the cross, giving millions the rich heritage of salvation in Jesus Christ. I want to tell the next generation about what Christ has done for all. ‘One generation shall praise your works to another’ (Psalm 145:4),” he said in an interview. Talking about the work, the publisher Matt Baugher said that: “There is something uniquely special about a father-son relationship. ‘Through My Father’s Eyes’ is not only analogous to one’s relationship with a heavenly father, it is in this case a powerful look into a man and his message that only a son could provide.  We’re honored to work with Franklin Graham on such an important and meaningful project.” Rev. Franklinis, chairman and president of Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian relief and evangelistic organisation, and also serves as president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.  He happens to be the fourth of Billy and Ruth Bell Graham’s five children. He is described as an avid outdoorsman and pilot, who lives with his wife Jane Austin in North Carolina where they have raised four children and now have ten grandchildren. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
