Pakistan on Friday imposed travel restrictions on U.S. diplomats in the country following a similar decision by the U.S. administration, the Foreign Ministry said. Pakistan and the U.S. had announced restrictions on diplomats after a U.S. embassy vehicle driven by Colonel Joseph Emanual Hall, defence and air attache of the U.S. embassy in Islamabad, killed a Pakistani motorcyclist in Islamabad on April 7. Pakistan on Thursday confirmed that its diplomats in the U. S. would face travel restrictions from May 11. The United States had earlier planned to counter attack the curbs from May 1, but deferred the move for 10 days. “The restrictions will be implemented on Friday and these will be on a reciprocal basis. `However, negotiations are ongoing between the two sides on the matter,’’ Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mohammad Faisal said when asked to confirm reports whether the restrictions will be enforced or not. The relations between the two sides have been under pressure after President Donald Trump accused Islamabad in January of lying to the U. S. and offering “little help in hunting terrorists.’’ Washington later suspended its security assistance to Pakistan. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
