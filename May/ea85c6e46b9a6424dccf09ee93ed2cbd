Meanwhile, organisers of next weekend’s first-of-its-kind race in Okpekpe have warned that registered athletes must wear the temporary timing chip attached to their race number. Failure to wear this will result in the participant’s name being omitted from the results.This means such a participant will not be eligible for the prize monies on offer. ”The race number and temporary timing chip are linked to your name and finishing time.Allowing another person to compete with your number will result in disqualification of the other person and your exclusion from next year’s event,’warns Henry Amike,the elite athletes manager for the silver label race. Amike also revealed that the use of personal music players with headphones will not be allowed. 0 comments
