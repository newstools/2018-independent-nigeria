Awka – Asmau Idris, wife of the Inspector General of Police (IGP), and president of Police Officers Wives Association (POWA), on Wednesday empowered 37 women, including widows of police officers, in Awka. Mrs. Idris noted that the association’s main programme in 2018 was empowerment of the less-privileged in the society. According to her, the association had started with women and would extend it to the youths, explaining that the idea was to enable the beneficiaries to provide for their families. She also preached peace among the wives of police officers, especially in the barracks, noting that since their husbands were always on duty outside the barracks, it was the responsibility of their wives to keep the families intact and maintain peace in their places of residence. She said: “We are mothers, and since we are always in the barracks, we should live like a family.” Hajiya Khadija Umar, wife of Anambra State Commissioner of Police and chairperson of POWA in the state, said the state chapter of POWA had carried out several empowerment progammes for women in different skills and explained that most of them received start-up materials for their businesses. She also said that POWA would continue to embark on projects aimed at alleviating poverty in the state, adding that there were plans to establish a skills acquisition centre to train and re-train women and children of the police and the general public in the tailoring, baking, catering, bead making, make-over, knitting, soap and pomade making, among others. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
