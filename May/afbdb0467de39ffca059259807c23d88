Iran on Wednesday denied supporting and cooperating with the Polisario Front, one day after Morocco cut ties with Tehran, claiming that Iran’s regional ally Hezbollah supports the Western Sahara separatist movement. According to Foreign Minister Spokesman, Bahram Ghassemi, Morocco’s accusations are not true. “One of the principles of Iranian foreign policy is recognizing the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries and not intervening in their internal affairs,’’ Ghassemi said. Morocco on Monday ended its diplomatic relations with Iran, recalling its ambassador from Tehran and asking the Iranian envoy to leave Rabat. Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita said the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement was providing logistical support and training for the Polisario Front. Hezbollah has denied Moroccan claims that it backs the group, saying the North African country was bowing to foreign pressure in cutting ties with Iran. Western Sahara is a disputed territory in North Africa largely controlled by Morocco but also claimed by the Polisario Front. The dispute began in 1975, when the region was invaded by neighbouring Morocco and Mauritania after the withdrawal of colonial power Spain. Mauritania later withdrew and recognised the Polisario Front’s self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). 0 comments
