A financial expert and the immediate National President of Mbaise People’s Congress (MPC), Ochiagha Ano Anyanwu, has reacted to a newspaper report wherein Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State described the people of Mbaise as “clannish and limited by clannish politics”. He noted that Mbaise is the largest homogenous community in Imo State,  and advised Okorocha, “to stop making comments which tended to belittle the exalted office of the Governor of Imo State”, stating, “describing a section of the state as clannish is unbecoming of the Chief Executive of a State.” Anyanwu expressed shock at Okorocha’s tirade against Mbaise people and queried whether the Governor intended to malign and or blackmail the hardworking, hospitable and peace-loving people of Mbaise who are known for their industry, and sense of responsibility. He posited that Mbaise has produced very illustrious sons and daughters, who have held and still occupy sensitive and exalted positions such as the Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Governor of Central Bank, Deputy Governor of Imo State, Generals, Deputy Inspector General of Police, Ministers, Senators, professionals, Federal Permanent Secretaries, captains of Industry, professors and scholars, vice chancellors of universities, amongst others. He said that sons and daughters of Mbaise have responsibly used their positions to advance the cause of Imo State. According to Anyanwu, “of recent memory is the case of Emeka Ihedioha, who as a representative of Aboh Mbaise/Ngor Okpala Constituency in the House of Representatives was instrumental to the award of the N26 billion road dualisation project of Owerri – Elele Road” He further stated that the people of Imo State are fully aware of the damage that the current government in the state has done to the generally accepted principles of good governance. If anything is “clannish”, it is the current attempt by the governor to impose a family dynasty on the good people of Imo State. The joy of the people is in the strength of their votes to determine who becomes the governor of Imo State in 2019 Anyanwu concluded that no amount of name-calling and blackmail would prevent the people of Mbaise from participating in the emancipation of the people of Imo State and the restoration of the dignity of the people. 0 comments
