Lagos – Alex Iwobi has added to Nigeria’s injury lists as Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger confirmed on Sunday that he picked up an hamstring injury during the Gunners 2-1 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Iwobi who is one of the poster boys for the Super Eagles going to the 2018 FIFA World Cup joins Wilfred Ndidi, Joel Obi, Tyrone Ebuehi and Leon Balogun in the treatment room just weeks to the start of the summer World Cup in Russia. Iwobi and two other Arsenal players, Henrick Mhkitariah and David Ospina are doubtful for the return leg of the UEFA Europa League match against Atletico Madrid. “We’ll see how everyone recovers because Thursday will come around very quickly.” Wenger was unable to confirm whether any of the three would be available for Thursday’s game with the trio set to be monitored over the next 48 hours. Meanwhile, Trabzonspor of Turkey midfielder, Ogenyi Onazi was back in action for his club, after a bout with injury, as he confirmed his verdict last week that he has fully recovered and ready to roll again. That much came to pass on Saturday, as Onazi came through his comeback game away to Antalyaspor unscathed after recovering from a hamstring injury. The injury-prone defensive midfielder last figured for Trabzonspor on April 7 prior to Saturday’s game at Antalya Stadyumu. 0 comments
