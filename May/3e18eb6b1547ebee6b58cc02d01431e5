Abuja – In the bid to tame the proliferation of unqualified estate surveyors and valuers, and to safeguard the integrity of the profession, the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV) at the weekend, said it is collaborating with the security agents to fish out the fake elements in their midst. Rowland Abonta (ESV), the President of the Institution, disclosed this when he led the management team of the institution on a courtesy visit to the Abuja office of DAILY INDEPENDENT. He said that the institution has given ample opportunity for those who are ready to acquire formal training, and get certification, but those that remained defiant would be made to face the wrath of the law. He added that the institution will leave no stone unturned to sanitise the society of fake estate agents and estate valuers. “We are going into collaboration with Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and Nigeria Police and other security agencies that are responsible for stopping criminals from their activities . Since we know the operational base of some of these agents, and once they refuse to be part of the new system, definitely they will be picked up and put to check” Abonta explained that the tempo of advocacy and enlightenment programme would be increased to enable the public deal with the agency that have the symbol of the institution. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
