The United States and China are not likely to clash in any major way over trade, despite tensions created by US President Donald Trump’s hard economic line toward Beijing, US billionaire investor Warren Buffett said on Saturday. Buffett’s remarks come as the Trump administration called for a  $200-billion (€167-billion) cut in China’s trade surplus with the US, drastically reduced tariffs and a stop to subsidies for advanced technology at trade talks in Beijing, according to people familiar with the negotiations.
