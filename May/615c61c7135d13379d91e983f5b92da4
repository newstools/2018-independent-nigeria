ASABA  – Delta State government has denied the claims that it has abandoned the mother and conjoined twins delivered at the Delta State University Teaching Hospital, Oghara, in Ethiope East Council Area of the state. The government on Wednesday stated that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa was set to offset the treatment bill. Dr. Mordi Ononye, the state’s Commissioner of Health, who went to the hospital with his medical experts from the Ministry of Health to see the situation of the twins in order to seek medical advice from the Lead Consultants on the next line of action, warned reporters not to disseminate falsehood. He stressed that what were published on social media about the matter were not only untrue and wicked, but that it was the exact opposite of what was stated by the governor. 2 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
