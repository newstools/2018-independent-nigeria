Yemi Adebiyi, Chairman of Lagos State chapter of the Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA) has assured Nigerian writers of the excellent preparedness of Lagos chapter to host this year’s international convention. Speaking to Sunday Independent during the inauguration of the Local Organising Committee (LOC) in Lagos recently, Adebiyi said all hands are on deck to give the best treat to Nigerian authors. His words: “Of course you know Lagos is Centre of Excellence. Therefore, writers should expect the best convention from Lagos. We are fully prepared and we encourage all delegates to attend this memorable event. It is going to be a great opportunity to meet the great heroes in the media, business and politics. Mega city, Lagos is welcoming the delegates.” Corroborating the state chairman, Denja Abdullahi, national chairman has also said that the coming convention in October this year will be the best. “We have no cause to doubt Lagos. It is an opportunity to prove their mettle. The state chapter is making good effort. Recently, Steve Ayorinde, Lagos State Commissioner for tourism, art and culture announced that Lagos is waiting to witness several art bound events this year. He mentioned LABAF, ANA convention and others. This shows that the state government has been carried along. It is definitely going to be a great experience,” he said. ANA holds its international convention annually. The gathering unites all the stakeholders home and abroad. Apart from meeting great authors and publishers, the gathering has also served as a network for business and varied engagements in the past. It is also an avenue to learn new things in the literary world as experienced and seasoned resource persons are invited to present papers. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
