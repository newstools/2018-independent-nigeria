Newcastle United boss Rafael Benitez has suggested that it should be regarded as a “a positive” that he wants more money to spend at St James’ Park. Benitez has successfully kept Newcastle in the Premier League this season, but the Spaniard has been left frustrated in the last two transfer windows and allegedly wants guarantees over the club’s plans before committing his future to the Magpies. The 58-year-old has admitted that there have been no developments behind the scenes, but acknowledges that he would prefer to be focusing on ways to take the club forward. Benitez is quoted by Chronicle Live as saying: “I would be happier just thinking about my team, my players, the tactics, analysing other teams and improving players. But in modern football and especially in the Premier League, the budget is crucial. So you see a club like Man City, an amazing coach with an amazing team and they could not win last year. “They had to spend a lot of money to win . The reality is with the prices in the market now, you need the money to compete. Sometimes people think that is negative but I think it is a positive because it means you care. So I am not thinking about myself.” Benitez spent £45m last summer but much of that outlay was offset by player sales. 0 comments
