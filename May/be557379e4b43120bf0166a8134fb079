Atletico Madrid Make Last-Ditch Offer To Stop Griezmann’s Barcelona Move Atletico Madrid have made a huge last-ditch contract offer to Antoine Griezmann in an attempt to keep him away from Barcelona, reports the Daily mail. The 27-year-old has been widely expected to join the Catalans in the offseason, with Barca offering the attacker a contract worth around €15 million (£13m/$18m) per season. However, Atleti’s contract offer is substantially higher, with Diego Simeone’s side willing to give the Frenchman €25 million (£22m/$29m) per season. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
