Chinese National Political Advisors convened a bi-weekly seminar on Friday to advice on the drafting of a regulation on protecting children in cyberspace. The advisory body serves as a platform in which political advisors contribute their expertise to decision-making. “The party and government forge consensus about their policies,’’ Wang Yang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), who presided over the meeting, said in a speech. Wang said that relevant authorities and political advisors conducted constructive exchanges about the topic. Seventeen political advisors and representatives from academia and business circles put forwards their suggestions, according to a press release issued after the meeting. They agreed that a regulation was necessary and should strike a balance between government and business, family and society, as well as the immediate effects and long-term institutional setup, the statement said. Some advisors suggested that more attention should be paid to institutional design such as a system to identify harmful and negative information for minors, limiting children’s time on the internet and raising awareness among minors. They noted that families, enterprises, schools and society should all participate in protecting children in cyberspace while the government should play a leading role. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
