LAGOS – Christian Chukwu, former Super Eagles handler has cautioned Nigerian players to approach the game against DR of Congo with caution and follow the instructions of coach Gernot Rohr as nothing is at stake. Chukwu in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT on Sunday reasoned that the game is being organised simply for the assessment of the team ahead of the World Cup proper. “As a former coach at the international and local levels, I know what a friendly game means to a country preparing for international tournament like the World Cup – it is just mere assessment to know the level of preparedness of the team and work on the grey areas. “This is why my advice for the players that they should play with caution; they should be very careful and play according to the instruction of the coach, because any injury will be suicidal to the team and the players,” Chukwu warned. Chukwu in this regard believed that with few days to the world’s most popular football fiesta, the coach could have drawn up his final list as the game is one of the final trial games for participating countries. “There’s no showmanship that a player will put up tomorrow that will change the mindset of Rohr on the final list of the team – he already knows the 23 players to pick,” Chukwu concluded. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
