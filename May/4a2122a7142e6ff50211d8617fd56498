Six people were injured in clashes that broke out on Sunday at a refugee camp in the Greek village of Lagadikia, east of Thessaloniki, local media reported on Monday. According to The National Herald newspaper, the three-hour fight involving about 250 people broke out after some Syrian refugees accused a group of Algerians of harassing Syrian women. Refugees attacked each other with knives and wooden planks. “As a result of clashes, four people were arrested while six were injured and transferred to the Papageorgiou hospital,’’ the media outlet added.
