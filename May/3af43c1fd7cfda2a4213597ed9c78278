Warri – Michael Johnny, All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain in Delta State, is optimistic that Adams Oshiomhole as national chairman of APC will adhere to the power rotation by allowing the governorship candidate of APC to emerge from Delta North senatorial district. For him, this is the key to the party’s victory in the 2019 governorship election. Johnny, who spoke on Tuesday in Warri, also called on all APC delegates from South South to cast their votes for Oshiomhole at the forthcoming APC National Convention, noting that the former Edo State governor “has the capacity” to deliver the party at all levels in 2019. The Ijaw leader and activist, however, charged Oshiomhole to ensure that Delta North got the APC governorship ticket as already agreed, so that the zone could complete their eight years by 2023. He advised Oshiomhole to avoid the mistake made in Bayelsa APC governorship primary, which was responsible for the party’s loss at the general election, noting that the 2019 governorship election in Delta is very serious project for APC. “In Delta State, rotation of governorship has come to stay. The Delta North has eight years mandate; so the APC governorship candidate should come from Delta North if the party really wants to take over power from PDP and Governor Ifeanyi Okowa in 2019. “As Deltans, we must be fair to ourselves; we cannot afford to deny Delta North senatorial district its eight years mandate. We from Delta Central and Delta South enjoyed our respective eight years in office; therefore, I am advising the incoming national chairman of APC, Adams Oshiomhole, to maintain the existing power rotation in Delta State.” 1 comments
