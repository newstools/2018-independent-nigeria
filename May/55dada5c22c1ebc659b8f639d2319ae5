Alex Iwobi is confident Nigeria can “beat any team” at the World Cup because the players of the Super Eagles are a strong unit. Iwobi, who earned his first cap in 2015, has gone on to become one of Nigeria’s brightest stars and surely one to look out for in Russia. The youngster came through a decent season – on a personal level – for Arsenal, but wants to do even more when Nigeria gets its campaign at the tournament underway. In a chat with Brila.net Iwobi oozed with confidence as he declared his readiness for the world cup and Nigeria’s ambition to give the world a spectacle. Nigeria will open their 2018 FIFA World Cup against Croatia on 16 June at the Kaliningrad Stadium. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
