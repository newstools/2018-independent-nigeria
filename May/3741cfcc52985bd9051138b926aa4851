Lagos – Amkar Perm football club of Russia defender, Brian Idowu, who is one of the 30-man provisional list invited in preparations for the World Cup, has promised to justify the coach’s confidence in him. “It’s been a remarkable experience for me. One minute nobody knew me and the next I have the chance to play at the World Cup. “It is more like a dream for me, really. I promise to give my best always in order to justify the confidence of the coaches.” According to him, he said that he appreciated the once in a lifetime opportunity given to him by Nigeria to play in the World Cup. Idowu made his international debut for the Super Eagles in last November’s international friendly game against Argentina in Russia and scored one of the goals in the 4-2 win for the Super Eagles. Born of a Russian mother, Idowu is also eligible to play for the 2018 World Cup hosts but he claimed the decision to play for Nigeria was a very easy one to make for him. “My father’s from Nigeria and I know he’s always going to be proud of me. Besides Nigeria gave me the opportunity to play for the national team and I will be forever grateful for that.” He is one the 27 players already sweating it out in Uyo in preparations for the team’s remaining friendly matches ahead of the World Cup. The team will play Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Monday, May 28 at the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium in Port Harcourt. After the game, Super Eagles are expected to fly out to London to take on Three Lions of England at the Wembley Stadium on June 2 and later play Czech Republic in their last friendly match. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
