Lagos – Super Eagles defender, Leon Balogun and his German Bundesliga side, Mainz 05 may cross part as his contract set to run out in the summer. The 29 year old who is currently being target by Schalke 04 is also courting interest from English Premier League side, Huddersfield Town. However Mainz 05 officials have not given up on keeping him after surviving relegation to the second tier in Germany on Saturday. SUNDAY INDEPENDENT gathered that the club officials are willing to offer him fresh terms but it appears he has made up his mind to continue his career elsewhere hence he isn’t interested in their ‎decision to offer him fresh terms on a new deal. This season he has played 14 games in the German Bundesliga, three less than his entire tally for last season, which is also four less of the total appearance he made in his first season at the club. Meanwhile, he has expressed his delight as his team avoided the drop in Bundesliga after beating Borussia Dortmund 1-2 at the Signal Iduna Park on Saturday, May 5. The result means that Mainz are 14th in the Bundesliga with 36 points and just one round of fixtures left to play. Mainz have six points more than Wolfsburg who occupy the final relegation spot and have therefore survived the drop. After the result of the game Balogun took to his official Twitter account to express his happiness with a message that said,  “What a way to safe the league!!! It was a hard season with a lot of ups and down.” “This year definitely showed us that every single soul is needed to reach our goals. Congrats to the whole club, the team, the staff, the employees, family & friends and of course the fans.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
