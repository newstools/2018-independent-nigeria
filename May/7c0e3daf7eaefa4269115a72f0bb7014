Martin Selmayr’s promotion to become the European Commission’s top civil servant was a “coup” against Europe, a leading member of the European Parliament wrote in an opinion piece published Saturday. Ingeborg Grässle, who chairs the Parliament’s Budgetary Control Committee, said promoting Selmayr from Jean-Claude Juncker’s chief of staff to deputy secretary-general and then almost immediately to the post of secretary-general was not a “spontaneous idea.” The German MEP — a member of the Christian Democratic Union, which is part of the center-right European People’s Party (of which Juncker and Selmayr are also members) — wrote in Liberation that the promotion shows the Commission does “not respect its own rules.” In March, the parliamentary committee that Grässle chairs held a public hearing on the promotion with Günther Oettinger, the human resources commissioner. MEPs passed a resolution in April calling for a re-think on the appointment and demanding reforms to employment rules at the Commission. While Juncker’s Cabinet has around 30 staff, the Commission’s secretariat general covers a sprawling workforce of over 30,000 which Selmayr will now effectively need to manage, Grässle said. “Selmayr, admittedly endowed with great know-how in daily political affairs, is a public servant with no experience in the management of the directorates-general, since he has never managed a department since the beginning of his career in 2004,” wrote Grässle. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
