In a video that surfaced on Twitter, Ekiti State teachers disagreed with Governor Ayodele Fayose over non-payment of their salaries. In the video, Fayose was embarrassed and booed as he struggles to announce the amount gotten by the state from the Federal Government as allocation. Some of the workers, who spoke in the video, accused Fayose of being the only Governor left behind in the payment of teachers’ salaries in the South Western region of Nigeria. When the Governor realized that he was being booed and not given attention, he attempted to force them to listen. Commenting on the video, Taiwo_Ajakaye @dmightyangel, said: “ Wait o, are you saying Fayose also is reading “transmission transmission” from that book? Hahahahahaha” Ayodeji added: “This video speaks one thing. If the people can come together with one voice and one mission, we will definitely throw these guys out of government.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
