Enyimba have beefed up their CAF Confederation Cup campaign with Nasiru Sani ahead of their weekend group stage opener with Djoliba AC of Mali. Enyimba’s chief coach, Usman Abdallah, said that they decided to include Sani because of his improvement since he joined them at the beginning of the season. “We are including Nasiru Sani in our CAF Confederation Cup squad and we are processing his registration with the Confederation of African Football,” Abdallah told Goal. “He has really improved since he joined us at the start of the season and now that we feel that we need to improve our squad, we decided to add him. We need all the good players we can get to the next stage we are in and he is among those we have found. “We are hoping his registration will be complete before the weekend game with Djoliba. We are also trying to see if we are able to add few more.” The former African champions cruised to the group stage at the expense of Bidvest Wits of South Africa whom they eliminated on the away goal rule and they are in Group C alongside Djoliba (Mali), Williamsville AC (Cote d’ Ivoire) and CARA Brazzaville (Congo). 0 comments
