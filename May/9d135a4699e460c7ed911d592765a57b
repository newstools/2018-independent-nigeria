It looks like there’s a truce upcoming in this never-ending battle of the exes! Chris Brown and Nia Guzman may have gone blow after blow in what seemed like a never-ending custody war the past few years, but brighter days are ahead — like, on Sunday, when Brown and Guzman will officially call a (temporary?) truce and throw a joint fourth birthday party for their daughter Royalty! Oh, and here’s the kicker: the party is supposed to cost “well north of” $30,000 for the newly-minted co-parents. Crazy!!! Apparently, Royalty wanted to a princess ball for her birthday, so Chris and Nia went over the top with it, according to TMZ. That means Every Disney princess will be there — from Jasmine to Cinderella and even a fairy godmother — along with a real-life horse and carriage set-up with a grand duke and a coachman. That also means the food menu is CRAZY! Crab cakes and all the sushi you can eat for the adults, plus PB&J, mac & cheese, and burgers on the menu for the kids. Not bad!!! As for entertainment, KIDZ BOP will apparently be there to perform on Sunday, plus up-and-coming R&B singer Tone Stith will sing… and hey, maybe there’s a shot Royalty’s daddy will step up to the mic, too!! Regardless, that sounds like an incredible fourth birthday party… ah, to be on that guest list Ha!!! 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
