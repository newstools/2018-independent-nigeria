The top Palestinian legislative body on Friday re-elected Mahmoud Abbas as President of the Palestinian Authority and Chairman of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). He has held both posts for decades. Following all-night deliberations, the Palestinian National Council (PNC), which met for the first time in a regular session in 22 years, re-elected Abbas as president and named the 15 members of the PLO executive committee, which later elected him as its chairman. Abbas, whose reappointment was expected, caused an uproar during the four-day meeting for anti-Semitic comments in which he said the genocide of Jews in Europe by the Nazis was not because of the Jewish religion, but because of the Jewsâ€™ role in bank lending. Speaking at the closing session of the PNC afterwards, Abbas said the assembly reached a consensus among all its political factions on the 15 members and left three seats of the 18-member executive committee open for the factions that had boycotted the meeting Those factions included the Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which are not members of the PLO and the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a founding member of the PLO. Most of the executive committee members were incumbents, with a few new members added to replace either deceased or aged members. 0 comments
