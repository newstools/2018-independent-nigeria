During his recent visit to Nigeria when he boldly spoke truth to power, world’s second richest man and Chairman, Bill and Melinda Foundation, Bill Gates, stressed that the self-acclaimed Giant of Africa is one of the most dangerous places to give birth in the world. The outspoken billionaire and large-hearted philanthropist made this mind-boggling revelation at the Expanded National Economic Council meeting presided over by the Vice-President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, in Abuja. He reportedly said: “Nigeria is one of the most dangerous places in the world to give birth with the fourth worst maternal mortality rate in the world ahead of only Sierra-Leone, Central African Republic and Chad. One in three Nigerian children is chronically malnourished”. This disturbing and highly indicting disclosure is a reflection of the level to which the health sector has degenerated in Nigeria over the years due to deliberate neglect of the all-important sector. Sadly, since the return of democracy on May 29, 1999 the decay in the health sector has assumed large-scale proportion. Nigeria’s health sector has deteriorated to the extent that the country now occupies an unenviable position of being ranked among poverty-ridden countries like Sierra-Leone, Central African Republic and Chad thereby carrying the stigma of most dangerous places to give birth in the world. Only recently, the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Health, Dr Osarenoma Uwaifo, disclosed that 756,000 under-five deaths occur in Nigeria every year, representing 11 percent of total global deaths of under-five. According to him, one in every eight children born in Nigeria dies before his fifth birthday, thereby making the country rank among countries with huge child mortality-related problems such as malaria, malnutrition, pneumonia and diarrhea. The health sector is virtually comatose due to government’s failure to accord it the attention it rightly deserves by increasing budgetary allocations to 13 percent as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) or the 15 percent declaration by the African Union (AU) in Abuja in 2001. A situation in which federal government budgeted N55.19 trillion but allocated paltry sum of N2.51 trillion to the sector between 2009 and 2018, is condemnable. In 2009, N3.049 trillion was budgeted out of which N103.8 billion, representing 3.4 percent was allocated while in 2010, N5.160 trillion was budgeted out of which N161.84 billion, representing 3.14 percent, was allocated. In 2011, N4.972 trillion was budgeted while N257.871 billion, representing 5.19 percent, was allocated compared with 2012 when N4.877 trillion was budgeted while N279.23 billion, representing 5.73 percent, was allocated. In 2013, N4.987 trillion was budgeted while N282.502 billion, representing 5.67 percent, was allocated compared with 2014 when N4.962 trillion was budgeted while N264.483 billion, representing 5.33 percent, was allocated. In 2015, N5.068 trillion was budgeted while N257.544 billion, representing 5.08 percent was allocated compared with 2016 when N6.061 trillion was budgeted while N250 billion, representing 4.13 percent, was allocated. In 2017, N7.444 trillion was budgeted while N308 billion, representing 4.14 percent, was allocated compared with 2018 when N8.612 trillion was budgeted while N340.45 billion, representing 3.95 percent was allocated. A situation in which Nigeria, according to President of Malaria Society of Nigeria (MSN), Dr. Babajide Puddicombe, has the highest number of malaria casualties globally with 300,000 deaths yearly, as well as highest cancer death rate in Africa, should be of great concern to Nigeria’s leaders. Recently, former Minister of Health, Dr. Onyebuchi Chukwu, revealed that Nigeria loses N175 billion yearly to medical tourism. Whereas this amount can be used to upgrade existing health institutions, establish world-class hospitals and equip them with modern facilities and improve working conditions of doctors and other health workers to motivate them for improved productivity. Government should pay more attention to preventive measures. More Public Health Centres should be established to enable those at the grassroots in local communities have access to health services at affordable rates. This will also reduce rate at which everybody troops to specialist hospitals in the cities where their charges are beyond the reach of poor Nigerians. Finally, government should ensure more Nigerians are brought into net of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) for them to have access to quality health services at reasonable costs.  0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
