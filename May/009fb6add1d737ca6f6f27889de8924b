He said, “Let’s create a special budget for development of Children because the rate at which we are producing them is very alarming. Over 60% of Nigeria population is for the children, they are growing very fast, and nobody is giving them any sense of belonging. Over 120 million in this country are below 30 years and nobody is talking about children in term of birth control in Nigeria.” The traditional ruler said, “We are just talking of spending money on infrastructure, if we build infrastructure, roads, power plants and others, who will take care of them? This country will be heading towards major crisis if the government fail to cater for the children. “I am then using this Children’s Day celebration for political class to know that there will be problem if you didn’t take care of the children. We don’t pray for any problem but we should take good care of the children,” he said. Amidst colorful display by the pupils of both public and private schools participating at the Palace of Ooni Of Ife, the pupils marched in colourful sportswear at the event and performed several cultural dances. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
