The Department of State Services (DSS) has released Sani Mohammed Baba-Inna, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) and ADC to Aisha Buhari, first lady, who had been in their custody, to the police. This is according to a statement by Peter N. Afunanya, the Public Relations Officer of the service, on Wednesday. It would be recalled that Baba-Inna was, on September 22, 2018, handed to the DSS by the police authorities for detailed investigations. He had been accused of defamation of character and unduly using his office and that of the first lady to fraudulently extort and obtain money from sources. He was alleged to have carried out the illegal and other unethical activities in the name of the first lady on whose behalf he falsely claimed to have acted. “The Department of State Services wishes to inform the public that it has released Sani Mohammed Baba-Inna, ADC to the first lady and wife of the president, Hajiya Aisha Buhari. He has been handed over to the police for further administrative action”, he said. The DSS said that investigation on the suspect, however, showed that he was never, at any given time or circumstance, directly or indirectly, instructed by the first lady to act or collect, in her name, money or material gifts from any person(s) or group(s). “In line with standard procedures expected in handling a matter of this nature, Baba-Inna is returned to the police for appropriate regimental action. Accordingly, the details of the investigation report have also been forwarded to the relevant authorities,” the statement noted.
