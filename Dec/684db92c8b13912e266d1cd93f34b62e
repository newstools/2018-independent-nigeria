Cahill joined from Bolton in 2011 for £7m and has gone on to become one of the club’s most decorated players, with a Champions League trophy, a Premier League and an FA Cup just a few of the honours he has won. He deputised as captain in Conte’s first season in charge as Chelsea stormed to a Premier League title, playing on the left-hand side of a back-three. But the Englishman has been used for just 21 minutes of league action this year, with the revitalised David Luiz a preferred option. The defender had already stated in September that if his playing-time did not improve he would look at possibly leaving in the winter. He said in September: “I don’t want to jump the gun but as things stand at this time, probably, yes [I might have to leave in January]. “Having been a big part of things for six or seven years and played a huge part, I’m definitely finding it difficult this year to deal with that situation. “Everything gradually comes to an end. I’ve always been hungry to play football. I’m not a guy who is willing to accept not playing. It’s all about playing. Your career’s short enough as it is.”
