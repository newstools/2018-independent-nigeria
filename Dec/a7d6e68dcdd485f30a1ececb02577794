The royal tradition is to go pheasant shooting on December 26, but the Duke of Sussex won’t be taking part
Prince Harry has reportedly snubbed the royal family tradition of pheasant hunting on Boxing Day, December 26, because of Meghan Markle’s animal views. The 34-year-old royal has taken part in the annual hunt for over 20 years, and would go out shooting with his brother Prince William, and their father Prince Charles when he was younger. However, the Duke of Sussex has changed his ways and has opted out of the event, which will take place in Sandringham, just months after he married the former Suits actress in May 2018. Charles and William will still go ahead with the ritual, and will reportedly be joined by William’s son Prince George, who he has with wife Kate Middleton. Harry – who is expecting his first child with his wife – is believed to have opted out of the family event because Meghan, 37, is against animal cruelty, and is opposed to such bloody sports and wearing fur, as well as other animal products. But this will not be the first time Harry has not taken part in the tradition, as he pulled out of the hunt over the festive period last year. More recently Harry snubbed the grouse hunt at Balmoral earlier this year. It has been reported Meghan’s views are also influencing Harry’s style too. Harry is believed to have changed his wardrobe and has started to wear eco-friendly brands his wife adores. However, Meghan’s influence on Harry has reportedly taken its toll on his bond with his family, according to The Sunday Mirror. A royal source told the publication: “William sees this as another concerning example of his brother being pulled away from his family by his new wife. Harry’s always loved hunting and it has provided them with a great chance to bond as brothers. “But now it looks like Harry’s shooting days are over. It’s the latest point of contention between the Princes.” Grazia has contacted a Kensington Palace representative for comment.
