Prices of onions which started rising since August this year, owing to shortfall in supply from its major sources such as Zaria, Sokoto, Kano and Maiduguri have not yet come down. With the dried onions from Chad, a neighbouring country, waning out of the market coupled with limited supply from its main sources, prices of the commodity have persistently been on the high side, fluctuating   adversely to the dismay of consumers and traders. Many of the traders opined that they were not taken aback by the unfavorable prices since it is a seasonal problem. They also said that the state of the economy which had affected the value of Naira negatively had not helped the situation either as many of them could no longer sustain their normal purchases. Consumers were also not happy about the situation, but left with no other option than to patronise the commodity because of its nutritional benefits. Findings from a market survey across some states by the Business and Market Intelligence Unit of DAILY INDEPENDENT revealed that prices of the commodity increased further by over 15 and 45 per cent in few markets from October to December 14, 2018. Reasons for continued increase in prices of onions according to the survey were linked to scarcity arising from off-season effect and high demand especially from n Republic of Benin, a neighbouring country.  Restiveness in the North was also mentioned. Visits to Wuse market, Abuja, showed that prices of a 100kg bag of onions soared further from what was sold previously. for example prices of a 100kg bag of the commodity(violet)  that earlier went for between N14,000 and N15,000  grew by over  50 per cent, currently ranging from N22,000 to N23,000, depending on the size of the  bag and the bargaining power of the customer. Abdul Yisa, who trades in the commodity at the Wuse Market, Abuja, blamed the persistent rise in the prices of onions on unavailability resulting from off-season effect. He was however, certain that the prices would definitely crash in its season of plenty, which is fast approaching. For Achau Market, Kaduna, prices of a 100kg bag of the commodity were within the region of N23,500 and N24,000, up from N15,000 previously sold. Many of the traders attributed the hike to high demand, generally experienced during the period of scarcity. In Dawanau, Market, Kano, the situation was somewhat favourable, despite the slight increase in its prices. For instance, prices of a 100kg bag of onions currently goes for between N10,000 and N10,500 as against N8,500 sold before. This however, represents over 15 per cent rise, of which most of the traders ascribed to high demand from other region. In Gombe Main Market, Gombe, prices of onions were at an upward trend, especially with a 100kg bag currently going for between N19,500 and N20,000 against  N14,000 sold initially. Many of the traders connected the unfavorable prices to off-season effect. The same could be mentioned for other markets outside the Northern region, although prices were more exorbitant. At the Igbudu market, Delta State, prices of a 100kg bag of onions soared by over 15 percent, currently ranging from N32,000 to N33,000   against between N27,000  and N28,000 sold formerly. Alhaji Seidu Usman, who trades in the commodity at the Igbudu Market, Delta State, blamed the hike on inadequate supply occasioned by season of lack. This is just as mallam Musa Subair of same market, agreed to his submission as he also connected the situation to inflation which had made Naira to lose its value. Umuahia Main Market, Abia State, also witnessed an upward trend of  28 per cent, escalating to between N32,000 and N33,000 from N25,000 initially sold. A large portion of the traders attributed the hike to unavailability and high cost of logistics. A lady who simply identified herself as Rebecca Ibaji, but retails in the commodity at the Umuahia main Market, told DAILY INDEPENDENT that the outrageous prices had forced some traders to abandon the trade for a cheaper one. That of Ninth Mile Market, Enugu , was also  affected adversely as a 100kg bag that previously went for between N18,000 and 19,000 attracted  N25,000  within the review week. At the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, prices of a 100kg bag of onions sold for N37,000 previously declined within the region of N33,500 and N34,000 as at December 14,2018. A man named Joseph Oyedeji who sells the commodity at the Lafenwa Market, Ogun State, said the principal cause of the hike was inadequate supply arising from off-season effect but opined that the increase was outrageous and very evident due to the weakening value of Naira. That of Bodija Market, Ibadan, was not different  but on a higher side, especially with prices of a 100kg bag of onions (violet) currently selling for between N47,000 and N48,000 up from between N32,000 and N33,000, signifying a 46 percent rise,  from that of  October. Many of the traders in Bodija Market, Ibadan, believed that seasonal factor coupled with high cost of transporting the produce from the North were responsible for the continued hike. For Lagos, prices of onions rose sharply when compared with what was sold in October, as visits to popular Mile 12 and Iddo Markets, revealed. For example, a 100kg bag of onions (violet) that soared to N35,000 in October from N15,000 previously sold, soared further to between N42,000 and N43,000, a 20 or 22 per cent increase. A man who simply identified himself as Baba Yellow, an onion seller at the Mile 12 market, linked the high prices to scarcity but was very optimistic that prices of the commodity would drop, with increased harvest this month. Another trader, Peter Nwosu, from same market also connected the hike to limited supply, stressing that the disappearance of the dried onions (white species)   from Chad, a neighbouring country, coupled with high demand from Republic of Benin traders worsened the situation.
