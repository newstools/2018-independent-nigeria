Lagos – Theophilus Afelokhai and Ikechukwu Ezenwa, two Super Eagles goalkeepers, have agreed that other countries would be in for a shock when the Africa Cup of Nations begins in the summer of 2019. Both goalkeepers, who were former team mates at Enyimba before Ezenwa signed for Katsina United, while speaking to DAILY INDEPENDENT in separate chats, said that the Super Eagles would surprise other countries with their brand of football which has seen them qualified for the Cup of Nations even with a match to spare. “We did not qualify for the last two Cup of Nations and I am sure that other countries may be looking at us in that direction. But I am sure that they would be surprised because of the winning mentality the coach has brought back into the team. Nigerians and other African countries will see a different Super Eagles and I think the ultimate title is not out of our reach once we prepare very well,” Ezenwa said. On his own, the Enyimba number one goalkeeper, Afelokhai, said it was necessary that the team prepares adequately, reasoning that with the kind of talent in the Super Eagles, and coupled with adequate preparation, they could surprise the continent. “I believe so much in this Super Eagles because there are quality players in all departments. All the team needs now is good preparation and after that, we will see how it goes. But I know that Super Eagles have what it takes to surprise everyone and possibly win the cup next year,” he said. Both goalkeepers are the only home base stars currently being considered by Coach Rohr in the team.
