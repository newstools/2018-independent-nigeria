Osogbo – Chief Gani Adams, the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, has warned against infiltration of Fulani herdsmen into any part of the region. He vowed to protect the area with the last drop of his blood. He expressed these against the backdrop of the killing and abduction of staff and students of the Osun State College of Technology, Esa-Oke, on Tuesday evening by suspected Fulani herdsmen. Chief Adams spoke through the Osun State Coordinator of Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC), Prince Adedeji Aladesawe, and expressed resentment at the killing of innocent people. It would be recalled that on Tuesday evening, some people suspected to be Fulani herdsmen stormed the home of the late Chief Bola Ige, Esa-Oke, killed a staff and abducted no fewer than ten persons. Four of the abducted persons have been rescued by the police while others are still missing. He said the Yoruba region was as important to him as blood flowing in his vein, assuring that he would, within his capacity, protect the lives and property of his kinsmen. While condemning the incident, Adams said killing in the South-West by unknown gunmen was unacceptable to him and stressed that he would soon summon a stakeholders’ meeting in his capacity as Aare Onakakanfo to discuss how such dastardly acts could be prevented. He, however, charged sons and daughters of the Yoruba to be calm and assured that invasion of outsiders to claim innocent lives would soon be a thing of the past in Yorubaland. He warned evil perpetrators to stay away from the territory and also charged them to be civil in their acts.
