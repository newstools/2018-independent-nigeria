The lead singer of an Indonesian pop group who watched his bandmates die as a tsunami ripped through their concert has today buried his wife who was killed in the audience. Riefian Fajarsyah, 35, wrote a heartbreaking tribute to his wife Dylan Sahara, 25, on Instagram today alongside a photo of him caressing her coffin. He was the only surviving member of Seventeen, who have released around six albums and has a large fan base in Muslim-majority Indonesia. Fajarsyah posted a picture of his wife alongside the caption: “How can I live without you?” His band Seventeen were performing to a crowd of 200 people on Saturday when a 20ft wave smashed over the crowd. The horrific disaster, which took place at 9.30pm, happened a day before Dylan’s 26th birthday.
