Afro pop star, Ayodeji Balogun aka Wizkid, surprised fans when he performed at Olamide’s Adedeji aka Baddo’s concert in Lagos shortly after his own show. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that in spite holding on the same day, Sunday, Wizkid’s ‘Made in Lagos’ concert and Olamide’s ‘Live In Concert’ (OLIC) were sold out with fans trooping to support each artist. At about 2 a.m, Wizkid kicked off a live set at his own festival which spanned over one hour. After the electrifying show, he made it to Olamide’s concert where he delivered a brief but stunning performance of ‘Kana’. NAN reports that Nigerians on social media spared no time to share their excitement over the support shown by Wizkid amidst claims that the date clash would affect the impact of both concerts. They commended Wizkid for constantly supporting his colleagues and praised him for being able to perform at two concerts in one night. @Darey__ tweeted, “Before you lose your home training on this app! This is Wizkid live at #OLIC5 out to support Olamide! The sky is big for everyone to fly please. Much respect Starboy.” @OOUnetwork said, “Olamide’s #OLIC5 soldout. Wizkid’s #MadeinLagos soldout. Sometimes you don’t need to compete to attain success. God’s grace is sufficient for all.” @Lailaijeoma said, “Wizkid left his concert #MadaInLagos to perform Kana with Olamide at #OLIC5 When they say the sky is big enough for everyone, this is it!!!” @Adeyemijobest tweeted, “Maximum respect for wizkid turning up for #OLIC5 after his own show #MadeinLagos.” This was not the first time Wizkid had made surprise appearances at his colleagues’ concerts. In November, he surprised Wande Coal and Simi at their headline London shows held the same night.
