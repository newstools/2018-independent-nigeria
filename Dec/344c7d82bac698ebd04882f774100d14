While having a chin wag with mate Busy Philipps on her talk show Busy Tonight, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star recently shared some secret information about her brother. As the topic of imaginary friends came up, Kim dredged up the fact about her brother, seven years her junior, had a couple as she told busy: ‘My brother has…uh, I don’t know if he still does. But he had, for a really long time, two imaginary friends.’ As the two women had a little giggle, Busy asked if Kim remembered what their names were. Without missing a beat she said: ‘Pablo and Ronald.’ Perhaps not just relegated to his childhood, though, Kim hinted Rob still likes to reminisce about the trio he formed with Pablo and Ronald, as she added: ‘My brother literally has talked about these guys, like, up until last year.’ When asked if she too had her own imaginary friends, Kim was quick to say she didn’t – and that she also didn’t know anyone else who had imaginary friends. Quick to dispel the tension that may have formed, Busy admitted she had one when she was younger. ‘I had an imaginary friend…Derry Shackson,’ she said, before saying, ‘Me and Rob!’ Rob doesn’t seem to close with the rest of his siblings anymore, however any rumours of a rift were nipped in the bud by Khloe Kardashian earlier this week when she insisted she hadn’t forgotten about him. That’s nice. It all happened when one Instagram user said: ‘It’s a shame Rob Kardashian is a member of the family and he is NEVER mentioned.’ It didn’t appear to sit well with Khloe, who immediately fired back insisting people weren’t ‘informed’ on the situation with their brother. ‘My brother is my entire world! He is definitely a king,’ the mum-of-one wrote. ‘It is a shame that you can’t respect us for respecting his privacy. You should not comment if you truly aren’t informed on our family.’
