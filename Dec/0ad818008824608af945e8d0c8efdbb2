The National Pension Commission (PENCOM) is strengthening its compliance and ethical culture and institutionalisation of Know Your Customer (KYC) processes in the pension industry, Mrs Aisha Dahir-Umar, the Acting Director-General (DG) of the Commission has said. Dahir-Umar in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT yesterday said the KYC is aimed at creating a platform in line with Section 80 of the Pension Reform Act (PRA), 2014 for compliance officers to regularly meet and share ideas on how best to optimally perform their functions and promote standards of excellence for compliance officers, thereby constructively impacting the industry. She said: “In an effort to promote a stable and sustainable pension industry, the Commission adopted zero tolerance for non-compliance and consultative supervisory philosophy in the issuance of guidelines and the review of existing ones to further promote sound corporate governance in the industry and ensure the security of the pension assets. “In addition, the Commission has, this year, moved to a more risk based approach to supervising pension operators by aligning its supervisory framework with that of the Financial Services Regulation Coordinating Committee (FSRCC). “We believe this will promote better risk management in licensed pension operators. It is also important to mention that the Commission recently released the framework and guidelines for the implementation of the Micro Pension Scheme, which is targeted at increased participation of employees in the informal sector, multi-fund structure and revised guideline for Fund Accounting as well as revised circular for branch opening and service centre by PFAs. “Similarly, circulars on pension enhancement and processing procedures of deceased benefits entitlement were also released by the Commission. The monitoring and reporting of non-compliance with regards to the implementation of these guidelines and other existing regulations remain part of the responsibilities of the Compliance Officers.”
