AWKA – Chief Victor Umeh, the Senator representing Anambra Central senatorial district, has said that states can pay new minimum of N30,000 if the revenue sharing formula is revised to favour states. Umeh who spoke in an interview on Wednesday said there was need for the Federal Government to reduce its share of the Federation Account to liberate more money for states to carry on with their programmes. He lamented that the decisions of the 2014 National Conference was jettisoned by the present administration and that if it had been put to work, most of the nation’s problems would be solved. Umeh noted that without putting the report of that National Conference to work Nigeria looked like a bakery where everybody weent to take a bite and left without thinking of how to bake one. He said same thing applied to restructuring which the confab also recommended, stressing that unless the nation was restructured its problems would continue. Umeh warned that only political parties that offer concrete promises to Nigerians on restructuring would win next year’s election. On whether the National Assembly could assist in the restructuring programme, Umeh said it would take the cooperation of the President to achieve that.
