Lagos – CD Leganes of Spain defender, Kenneth Omeruo has sent a plea to the top-flight La Liga club to shell out €5m, in order to buy his contract from Chelsea. Omeruo said he is so happy with his status since moving on loan from Chelsea to Leganes in the summer, such that the Super Eagles stopper is now keen on getting a permanent deal in Spain. Omeruo failed to play a single competitive senior match with Chelsea, which he joined from Standard Liege of Belgium in 2012, such that the dark-skinned defender feels Spain is where the brightest prospects for his career lies in 2019. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that Omeruo is ready for a permanent deal at Leganes, who will need five million Euros to buy the 25-year-old star on a permanent basis from Chelsea in the summer. Omeruo stated that Leganes make him feel at home, as he played their last 10 league games and have overcome an early relegation scare at the start of the season. The dark-skinned former Sunshine Stars of Akure star said: “I feel more at home. It has been quite amazing and interesting. “I am feeling more and more fulfilled playing in a top league. It’s like a dream come true for me.”
