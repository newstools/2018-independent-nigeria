ABUJA – President Muhammadu Buhari has again rejected the amendments made to the Electoral Act by the National Assembly. This would mark the third time the President would be rejecting fresh amendments made to the Electoral Act by the National Assembly. Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate) Ita Enang gave the indications on Friday when he spoke to State House correspondents. He simply said President Buhari has taken a decision on Electoral Act Amendment bill 2018, noting that it was in accordance with his power under the 1999 Constitution. Enang, who was being diplomatic about the amendment bill said the presidency has communicated that decision to the Senate and House of Representatives in accordance with the law. Beyond the bill, Buhari assented to National Open University Amendment Act, which now allows the National Open University to operate like all other conventional universities. By implications, NOUN would have similar power and leverage to function, including the same administrative structures eliminating possible discrimination. It has also allowed the establishment of some centres to be called study centres and given conditions for the establishment of such study centres.
