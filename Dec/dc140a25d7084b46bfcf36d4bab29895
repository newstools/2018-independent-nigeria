Chance the Rapper has left the US on his first sabbatical, saying he is “going away to learn the Word of God”. Chance has always been clear that he views himself as a “Christian rapper”, but said on Instagram that he is “definitely guilty of not devoting time to [the Bible]”. He plans to spend his sabbatical reading the holy text, and presumably will be taking a brief hiatus from music. They were believed to be working on a seven-track album titled Good Ass Job, though there are still no firm details on the release. Chance’s Instagram post in full: “I’m on a plane headed out the country on my first sabbatical. I’m going away to learn the Word of God which I am admittedly very unfamiliar with. I’ve been brought up by my family to know Christ but I haven’t taken it upon myself to really just take a couple days and read my bible. we all quote scripture and tell each other what God likes and doesn’t like but how much time do we spend as followers of Jesus to really just read and KNOW his Word. I’m definitely guilty of not devoting time to it. So I’m off to read and learn because the next generation of Bennett is here and I need to be able to give my nephew Charlie Matthew the knowledge and tools to FUCK YALL UP. Lol but seriously he’s the first boy of the next line and he needs his uncle to be educated. So dont bother me, ill be back soon enough, with five or more books from bible read. Oh yeah and cigarette free.”
