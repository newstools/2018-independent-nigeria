Diana Feldmann, who lost her daughter in a brutal murder, confessed to by 21-year-old Ali Bashar from Iraq, revealed to The Jerusalem Post that the murderer received a “fan page” on Instagram as some celebrated her daughter’s murder. Although she refuted the speculations that the killing had anti-Semitic motives, she said that some people had praised the Iraqi for killing a Jewish “slut” on this “hater” account, now deleted, and posted collages with Susanna and a burning Israeli flag. According to the grieving mother, she was aware of her daughter’s close relations to the confessed murderer’s family as Susanna had “fallen in love” with his 14-year-old brother KC. Susanna also told her that they stole, dealt drugs, but insisted they never did anything to her. However, she fights off accusations of bad parenting and says that she warned her daughter about the dangers because the girl couldn’t know where they’re from, what they’ve been through, how these people tick, and “what goes on in their minds”. Diana Feldmann stated that her daughter’s sweetheart KC lured her for his brother and his suspected accomplices, including a 35-year-old Turk. According to her conclusion, the rape was planned, although she is unsure if the killing was also on the perpetrator’s mind before.
