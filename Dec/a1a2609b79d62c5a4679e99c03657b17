Still smarting from their loss against the Kaduna based club, who defeated them 8 points to 7 in last edition final played at the Old Parade Grounds in Abuja, Cowrie will hope to avenge the loss when they meet at the main bowl of the National Stadium, Lagos by 2pm . Speaking ahead of the grudge game, Cowrie RFC Team Manager, Dele Coker is confident that his team have what it takes to defeat Barewa. According to him, with the numbers of talented players in their fold which has seen the team winning the Lagos league for the past 7 years, they are sure of victory come Saturday. ‘’Very few squads in the country can boast of talents Cowrie have and against Racing and Police in the Lagos League, they showed excellent composure and a clinical edge and I expect them to improve on that. Barewa club coached by Martin Crawford has won the NRFF organized Northern League for four straight seasons. Both teams having the highest number of home base players in the national team will have everything to play for as the national team Coach, Bronson Weir, is expected to use the match to assess new players to be invited to the national team.
