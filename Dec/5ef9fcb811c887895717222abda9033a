According to a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Adeniyi Adesina, Governor Oyetola described the former president as a man of honour, who lived a life worthy of emulation. The governor said ex-President Shagari demonstrated politics without bitterness when he deservedly awarded the country’s highest national honour of Grand Commander of the Federal Republic (GCFR) to the leader of opposition Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN), the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, in 1982 He said although the honour was reserved for only presidents/heads of state, Shagari recognized the contributions of the late sage to nation building by his non-partisan action. Governor Oyetola added that Shagari maintained a dignified posture and respectability out of office. He urged today’s politicians to emulate the attributes of the late former president who served the country diligently and to the best of his ability in various capacities from the pre-independence era through the First Republic and eventually as Second Republic President between 1979 and 1983. He prayed that Allah will grant his family and Nigerians the fortitude to bear the huge loss.
