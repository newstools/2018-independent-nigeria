Segun Olaniyan Katsina – Katsina State government contract workers have raised alarm over alleged move by the state government to relieve them of their jobs. The forum, ‘Katsina State Contract Workers Forum,’ made this assertion on Thursday while briefing journalists of their predicaments in Katsina. Mr. Ogalah Ibrahim, the forum’s coordinator, alleged that members of the forum who are mostly non-indigenes were recently notified of their disengagement by the state science and technical education board. “Right now another batch of 217 contract workers has been penciled down for disengagement with immediate effect. The list of those affected is available in the office of staff officer Katsina State Ministry of Education.” According to him, the recent government action on contract workers is making the workers helpless, as most of them could not cater for the essential needs of their family. The leader of the forum alleged that since 2012, contract workers in the state service were not paid arrears of their leave grant and the 15% monthly contract addition. The forum appealed to the state governor, Alhaji Aminu Bello Masari to look into their plight with a view to addressing them.
