Both players, who have been instrumental to Arsenal’s good run under new manager, Unai Emery, were nominated alongside 32 others for the 2018 award, with two Super Eagles players, Odion Ighalo of Chinese side, Changchun Yatai, and Ahmed Musa of Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia also making the cut. Taking to their twitter handle, the former English champions noted that both players would be flying the Gunners’ flag during the most prestigious football award on the continent, saying that they were up for the awards. “Auba and #BIG17 flying our flag at the Confederation of African football Awards.

Aubameyang won the most prestigious individual award in Africa back in 2015 beating off competition from Yaya Toure and Andrew Ayew. He came second behind Riyad Mahrez in 2016 and was third on the list in 2017 when Mohammed Salah won the award. He will be one of the favorites to win the 2018 edition having been in impressive form for Arsenal.
