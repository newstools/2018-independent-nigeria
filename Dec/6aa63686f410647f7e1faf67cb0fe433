The digital rights and inclusion group, Paradigm Initiative has expressed concerns over the delay in transmitting the Digital Rights and Freedom Bill (HB490) to President Muhammadu Buhari for his assent. The group in a statement by Sodiq Alabi, the organisationâ€™s Communications Officer, also urged the legislative and the executive arms to ensure the bill was signed before the 2019 elections. The group noted that the bill was initially passed by the Senate in March 2018 after being previously passed by the House of Representatives in December 2017. After an eight-month delay, the group said that the National Assembly reworked Clause 4 of the Bill after a concern was raised by the Directorate of Legal Services of the National Assembly. The new version of the bill was passed by the Senate last Tuesday, November 27. While speaking on the issue, Adeboye Adegoke, Digital Rights Program Manager for Paradigm Initiative, expressed concern over the assent of the President on the bill.
