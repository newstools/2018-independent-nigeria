Las Vegas has officially gone Gaga! More than a year after announcing her Las Vegas residency, Enigma, Lady Gaga took the stage on Friday night and showed the opening night crowd why she was worth the wait. Simply put, it lived up to the hype. The highly energetic show began with Gaga descending from the rafters to a standing ovation as “Just Dance” began to play. For the next 90 minutes, she played a combination of greatest hits and fan favorites, all while lasers continuously peppered the Park Theater. Throughout the majority of the show, Gaga spoke to a benevolent artificial intelligence graphic on the oversized screens, something she called both the “simulation” and her “enigma.”
