Real Madrid are happy to offer Chelsea both Isco and Mateo Kovacic as they step up their pursuit of Eden Hazard. According to reports in Spain, the Spanish giants are willing to offload two midfielders to help persuade Chelsea to sell their prize asset. Onda Cero claim the Champions League holders would be prepared to let Mateo Kovacic — who is already on loan at Stamford Bridge — and Spain international Isco join Chelsea as part of any deal for Hazard. Isco has fallen out of favour under new Madrid boss Santiago Solari, while Belgium international Hazard will be out of contract at the end of next season and has long been coy over his future. But now, he claims, his focus is on sealing his legacy at Chelsea. Hazard reached 101 club goals in the win at Watford and afterwards he said: ‘(The 101 goals) mean a lot especially because we won today. “One-hundred-and-one goals with this amazing club is something I will never forget! “Now I think me, the fans and players want more. I want to score more goals for the club and want to be a legend like (Frank) Lampard, (Didier) Drogba and try to be my best. “My target is to score goals and try to win the game. I try to do my best and today I did well.’
