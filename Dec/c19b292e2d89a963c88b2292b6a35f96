She recently admitted that hanging out with her motherÂ Tish, 51, prompted her to begin smoking weed again. Yet Miley Cyrus was flying solo as she headed to the Z100 Radio Station in New York on Monday morning. Looking effortlessly stylish for the outing, the 26-year-old singer dazzled in a shimmering silver blouse.The plisse fabric shirt flattered her petite frame, with blouson sleeves highlighting her tiny waist. She teamed the garment with high-waisted cigarette trousers, whilst metallic heels aided in elongating her lean legs. Miley finished off the look by styling her glossy golden locks in a sleek side parting and painting her plump pout with scarlet lipstick.
