LAGOS – The Lagos State Police Command has deployed additional five hundred policemen to various routes on the Lagos Island with special focus on Apogbon, Tafawa  Balewa Square (TBS), Eko Hotels and environs. The move, according to the police authorities, was in a renewed effort to curtail criminal activities and minimise gridlock in the area. Chike Oti, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) and the Command’s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), in a statement on Friday, said the deployment was done to boost the number of personnel already at various points in the area. The deployment, according to Oti, was necessitated by the series of events coming up on the Island, including, the Experience and Adekunle Gold Concert. He said that factored in the strategy, included people who would be embarking on religious programmes like RCCG Holy Ghost Congress at Redeem Camp and Shiloh at the Winners’ Chapel. He said that these programmes would lead to surge in vehicular and human traffic thereby bringing additional pressure to the already strained traffic situation in the commercial city resulting in gridlock. Otti said that to ameliorate the foreseen situation, Edgal Imohimi, the State Commissioner of Police, had directed that 500 policemen be posted to Lagos Island to boost the number of men already on ground in order to prevent crime and ensure smooth flow of traffic. Edgal, he said, had warned criminals who might want to take advantage of the upcoming events, to stay away from the Island and indeed the state as anyone caught would be summarily dealt with. He enjoined Lagosians to report suspicious characters and movements to the police through the following toll free emergency numbers 112 and 767. Oti also came out with lists of telephone numbers for Nigerians to use for complaints, which included what he termed Citizen Complaint Hot Centre lines. They are: 08067945296; 08063025274; 08063104759; 08113615350; 08113683077; 08096283148; 08096283173; 08089781657; 08126404930; 08081426895. Edgal said in addition to the policemen being deployed, the command would be collaborating with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), LASTMA and other relevant traffic management agencies to ensure smooth flow of traffic in the state. He assured residents of peaceful yuletide season and urged Lagosians to enjoy moderately during the festive period.
