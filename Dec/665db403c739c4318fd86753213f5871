Dave Berry has welcomed his first child with new wife Sarah-Jane. The Absolute Radio host took to Instagram on Sunday to share the happy news as he posted a picture with the newborn. Revealing the pair have had a daughter named Evangeline, he uploaded a black and white shot cradling his baby daughter. ‘Thank you to all of the hard working people at @uclh for being so knowledgeable, caring and wonderful. But of course my biggest thanks along with my eternal love and respect is for my wife who brought our perfect little daughter Evangeline into our lives. ‘The adventure ahead both excites and frightens us in equal measure.’ Dave first confirmed he was expecting his first child on the station’s Breakfast Show in August. Speaking on his show, he said: ‘I return from my holidays with news.’ ‘The news is, my wife and I are expecting our first child. Exciting but scary news. We are so, so happy it’s great.’ The presenter, who secretly married his other half in March in an intimate ceremony at Old Marylebone Town Hall, went on to explain about the joy of pregnancy pillows as he prepares to welcome his little one in December. ‘I’d never seen a pregnancy pillow before, never mind use one,’ he began. ‘Let me tell you I think that my performances on FIFA have gone up five or six notches.’ ‘Admittedly Sarah Jane who is the pregnant one is saying, “can I please have the pillow back because I really want a nap.” To which I reply, “Is it more important that you have a nap, or I get Charlton back into the Premiere League?”‘ In a serendipitous turn of events, Dave’s co-host Matt Dyson followed the announcement with the news that his wife is in fact also expecting their third baby. The presenter who also co-hosts Rock ‘n’ Roll Football with Matt Forde has two daughters. The thrilling news came six months after Dave secretly married Sarah-Jane in an intimate ceremony at Old Marylebone Town Hall.
