ABUJA – Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige has justified the refusal of President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the Petroleum Industry and Governance Bill (PIGB), saying the decision was to protect the interest of indigenous oil firms, especially taking control of the local content policies in the country. He said government through its indigenization policy of the oil and gas industry which later culminated in the enactment of the Nigerian Content Act, 2010 somehow exposed how foreign expatriates would have continued to dominate the industry till date. Ngige, represented by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Ibikun Odusote gave the disclosure on Wednesday in Abuja, at a programme commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG). He lamented the dearth of capacity in the industry, saying in spite of the fact that oil was discovered in Nigeria over 60 years ago, the neo-colonial stakeholders(Indigenous Firms) have not made conscious efforts to control the petroleum industry effectively. He said these factors necessitated deliberate policies of government some of which cut across Indigenization Decree, Petroleum Act, Petroleum Technology Development Fund Act, National Office of Technology Acquisition Act and Petroleum (Drilling and Production) Regulations among others.
