LAGOS – Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has assured Nigerians that the state will host the best National Sports Festival (NSF) since the inception of the festival in 1973. He made the promise at the National Stadium in Abuja on Sunday night moments after Edo State was handed hosting rights for the 2020 edition. Edo State finished third behind Rivers State and winners, Delta State at the just concluded 2018 edition hosted by Abuja. Obaseki thanked the Federal Government for reposing confidence in Edo State by handing it the hosting rights to the 2020 festival. “Ladies and Gentlemen, I and the people of Edo State assure you that the confidence reposed in us would be justified. There will not come a time anyone will have cause to regret this momentous decision you have taken to hand us this hosting right. We will take every step necessary, make every sacrifice needed, and climb every height necessary to deliver the best Games in the annals of the NSF.” Acknowledging that there would be challenges in hosting the festival, he said: “There will be challenges on the way, no doubt but we are Edo people. We have the men who can do the job and the facilities that will facilitate performance. “Whatever challenges there are, we will overcome because Edo people tread where even lions do not. Like our warriors of old, we will slay every foe and surmount every obstacle to succeed.” He said the 2020 festival would surpass previous festival in every respect. “The 2020 NSF will be different from any previously hosted and any that will come after it. Perhaps it can only be surpassed in splendour and organisation the next time Edo State hosts it afterwards. “Edo 2020 will be a festival thriving on ‘strategy, organisation, technical apparatus, science, mechanics, and morale,’” he said. He assured that in the end, Nigerians would be more than happy to have witnessed the festival.
