Olusegun Koiki and TOMI FALADE LAGOS – Yesterday almost turned to Friday of nightmares in Lagos metropolis as the Forte Oil Filling Station beside the Murtala Mohammed Airport was engulfed in a serious inferno. It was gathered that one of the tankers with fuel inside the filling station caught fire while attempting to offload fuel into the tank farm at the station. As at the time of filing this report, it was not so clear why the tanker exploded, but a source close to the station said that it may be due to a spark inside the filling station. At the station, several vehicles, which were parked, had to be driven out and there was palpable fear that the fire may spread to other parts of the airport especially the police station beside the filling station. The incident has caused a gridlock in the Ikeja axis of the state. Also, the 2018 Redeemed Christian Church of God’s Holy Ghost Congress, which had begun a few days ago was the place to be for the working population who couldn’t join in earlier in the week. Living Faith’s Shiloh at Ota, Ogun State was another major religious activity that many Lagosians could attend since it was Friday, but this all could not be compared to the crowd that headed to House On The Rocks’ The Experience, the annual gospel musical event acclaimed to be the largest gospel event in Africa and probably in the world that takes place at Tafawa Balewa Square, and attracts music artists, music lovers and enthusiasts from all over the world.
