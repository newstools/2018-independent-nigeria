Emmanuel Zira, the Chairman, Adamawa United Club, has expressed confidence that Lobi Stars FC of Makurdi will scale through the group stage of the 2018/2019 CAF Champions League. Zira, however, admitted that it would be a tough outing for the Nigerian club. With the draws conducted on Friday in Egypt, Lobi will play Wydad Athletic Club of Morocco, ASEC Mimosas of Cote d’Ivoire and Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa in Group A. Zira, whose club is in the Nigeria National League (NNL), said on Saturday in Abuja that the Moroccan club seem to be the biggest threat in the group. “The North Africans have improved their league standard and playing their teams is always a tough one. “Meanwhile, there is no minor in football; Lobi should take their chances and come out comfortably in this group. “If they (Lobi) can inject in the proper players and right tactics, they will surely have their heads high,” he said. Wydad were Champions in 2017, while Mamelodi lifted the title in 2016. ASEC, however, were title holders in 1998. The first games are expected to begin from Jan. 11, Jan. 12 and Jan. 13, 2019.
