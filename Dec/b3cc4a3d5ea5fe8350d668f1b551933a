LAGOS – Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) president, Amaju Pinnick, has charged the Super Falcons, to translate their African domination to the world stage. “Winning the African title has become part and parcel of the team, hence the NFF’s target is to ensure they go one step further in doing well at the World Cup in France”, said Pinnick, who is also first vice-president of Confederation of African Football (CAF). He assured that NFF would do everything to ensure that the team get early and good preparations for next year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup billed for France. He admitted that a lot of money would be required to give the team proper preparations for the Mundial, but promised that they will do all that was necessary to get the needed funds. He urged the players and officials to start looking beyond continental glory, as he reckons they need to aim for the world, now that they have won AWCON nine times. “This is the Super Falcons’ ninth African title, so the news is not that they won here. “The news is that the NFF will look for the resources to give the team solid preparations ahead of the FIFA World Cup in France next year. “This time, we will make a big impact at the FIFA World Cup and not simply go there to make up the number.” It will be recalled that the Super Falcons defeated the Banyana Banyana of South Africa 4-3 in the final of this year’s Women’s Africa Cup of Nations at the Accra Sports Stadium, Accra, Ghana. After losing their first group B match 1-0 against the South Africans, the Super Falcons bounced back to beat She-polopolo of Zambia 4-0 in the second match and mauled Equatorial Guinea 6-0 to set up a semifinal match against the Indomitable Lionesses of Cameroon which they won 4-2 through penalty kicks.
