Visa has extended its football partnership with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and the Union of European Football Association (UEFA). In its relationship with CAF, Visa will sponsor the Total Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournament in 2019 and 2021 and will be able to capitalize on football’s popularity throughout the continent. Visa is, however, partnering with the UEFA Women’s Football Competitions through 2025. Through its partnership, Visa will collaborate with UEFA for the 2021 Women’s European Championships in the United Kingdom and the annual Women’s Champions League beginning in 2019. Leveraging its sponsorship expertise and success at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia, Visa will implement its innovative payment technology at the tournament venues and deliver exclusive experiences for cardholders and clients.
