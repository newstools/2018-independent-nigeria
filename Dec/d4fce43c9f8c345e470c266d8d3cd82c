Ilorin – State governments across the country have been urged to stop leaving burden of financing polytechnic and colleges of education established by them to other agencies. Chairman of the Governing Council of Kwara State Polytechnic, Ilori, Salihu Musa, who gave the advice, said there was proliferation of state-owned polytechnic and colleges of technology with no commensurate adequate funding by the states. Musa, who spoke at the 25th convocation ceremony of the polytechnic at the weekend, said the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), which is one of sources of fund the institutions, was always meager and not very helpful. He said that the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETfund), which is another source, may soon be overburdened owing to multiplication of both public and private tertiary institutions. He said: “Proliferation of polytechnics and colleges of technology across the state, which are owned by the state, is rampant. They come with no commensurate adequate funding by the states. Funds from the IGR (alone) cannot do the magic. “Inadequate permanent academic personnel are similarly rampant in most of the institutions, while the population of non-academic personnel is of superfluous status as well as dearth of academic and administrative infrastructures and facilities. “The TETfund, which presently is the only grace, may soon be overburdened, as both the private and public institutions continue to multiply. Already, private institutions are mounting pressure for their shares of TETfund facilities, which are believed to be a national cake to be shared by all. “We, therefore, once again speak to state governments (owners of most of the institutions), to complement the efforts of the Federal Government in the funding of the institutions in all ramifications. “It is glaring that at the moment most state governments tend to leave their complementary roles for the growth and development of their institutions to the Federal Government via the TETfund.”
