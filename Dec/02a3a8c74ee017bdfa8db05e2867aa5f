LAGOS – Liverpool came from a goal down to massacre Arsenal 5-1 at Anfield and take a nine points lead at the top of the league. With this performance, Liverpool fans are beginning to dream of winning the league for the first time since 1990. Hopes of unpredictability that has characterize the Premier League was in the offing when against expectation, Arsenal took the lead on 10th minute through Ainsley Maitland-Niles, who finished an Alex Iwobi low cross. But four minutes later Liverpool were level when Firmino tucks it in. Firmino with a run from deep in midfield passed the ball to Mo Salah, whose shot is blocked by Xhaka. Mustafi tries to clear, but smashes the ball straight into Lichtsteiner, and it ricochets past Leno, and is heading in before Firmino tucks it away. Two minutes later Liverpool took the lead for the first time with Firmino scoring his second of the evening. Liverpool double their lead through Sadio Made who tucked in a Mo Salah pass. Any hope of a comeback for Arsenal was extinguished with Salah scoring their fourth of the night through a penalty. A controversial penalty in the 65th minute gave Liverpool their fifth goal with Firmino getting his hattrick of the night. Tottenham’s winning run was ended and their Premier League title challenge dented as they threw away a half-time lead to lose 3-1 to Wolves at Wembley. Spurs had won their previous four matches in all competitions — triumphing 6-2 and 5-0 in the most recent two — and it looked as if that run would continue when they took the lead through Harry Kane, who broke the deadlock in the 22nd minute with a sensational 25-yard strike. However, Mauricio Pochettino’s men were unable to hold their advantage and a jaded second-half display was punished in the final 20 minutes as Willy Boly, Raul Jimenez and Helder Costa all scored for the away side.
