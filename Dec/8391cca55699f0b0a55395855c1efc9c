 Lagos – Barely three days after Nigeria and Senegal battled in the final of the CAF Beach Soccer Cup of Nations in Egypt on Friday, in which the Senegalese whipped Nigeria 6-1 to retain the trophy; both countries will again play the final of the West Africa Union (WAFU) U-20 final. The final will hold at the U-20 Cup Tournament in Lome, Togo. Both teams qualified for the final through penalty kicks on Friday. The Flying Eagles came from behind to edge the Junior Eagles of Mali 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw. Sambou Cissoko got the Junior Eagles of Mali in front after only 11 minutes, but the Flying Eagles, who came from behind to tear apart Ghana’s Black Satellites 4-2 on Wednesday, equalized two minutes into the second half through Valentine Ozornwafor. In the first semifinal match, which also went into penalty kicks, Senegal and Niger Republic ended it 2-2, before Senegal prevailed 4-2 on penalties. Flying Eagles should be in their best form to stop the Junior Teranga Lions and avenge the defeat of the Super Sand Eagles in the final of the Beach Soccer Cup of Nations. No doubt, Coach Paul Aigbogun will depend on Emmanuel Effiom, Wasiu Alalade and Ibrahim Babawo to win the match for Nigeria. Meanwhile, President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, has urged the Flying Eagles to win the match. “You have tried reaching this stage of the tournament and what will make it a grand one for the team is to win the trophy now that you are in the final. “This will also serve as a sweet revenge for the Super Sand Eagles. The NFF is solidly behind you as well as millions of Nigerians”, Pinnick said.
