ABUJA – A non-governmental organisation, the Coalition of Civil Society Group, (CCSG), has commended the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for introducing Anchor Borrowers’ Programme, which has saved Nigeria over $21billion from food importation. It would be recalled that Godwin Emefiele, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had recently said $21 billion was saved from the cut in food importation between January 2015 and October 2018. Emefiele, who stated this at the annual bankers’ dinner in Lagos, said Nigeria’s monthly food import bill fell from $665.4million to $160.4million between 2015 and 2018. He said the reductions in food import were recorded on rice, fish, milk, sugar and wheat, adding that the policy would be maintained. Against this backdrop, CCSG said the apex bank Anchor Borrowers’ programme (ABP) had scaled down the huge foreign exchange spent by Nigeria on importation of food items. Addressing newsmen at the weekend in Abuja to close 2018 activities, Comrade Etuk Williams, President of CCSG, said the policies of the CBN had contributed immensely in stabilising the Nigeria’s economy. According to Williams: “The Coalition has noted the efforts of the bank to boost the availability of forex to end users through banks’ retail outlets as well as the reduction of the tenor of its forward sales from the hitherto maximum cycle of 180 days, to no more than 60 days from the date of transaction. “The bailouts for states through the CBN helped them to meet their obligations. The CBN- initiated Anchor Borrowers’ Programme (ABP) scaled down the huge foreign exchange spent by Nigeria on importing food items following its kick offs in Kebbi, Sokoto, Niger, Kaduna, Katsina, Jigawa, Kano, Zamfara, Admawa, Plateau, Lagos, Ogun, Cross-Rivers and Ebonyi and Imo States and hence directly impacted on the welfare of Nigerians.”
