LAGOS – The bearish run of the Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) All Share Index (ASI) was extended last week, as sell-offs in market bellwethers weighed on overall performance. As a result, the benchmark index posted losses on four of the five trading sessions in the week, falling 2.5 per cent week-on-week (W-o-W) to settle at 30,874.17 points. Likewise, year-to-date (YTD) loss further deepened to -19.3 per cent while market capitalisation shed N240.6bn W-o-W to close at N11.3trn. Similarly, trading activity weakened as average volume and value traded decreased by 25.2 per cent and 50.6 per cent W-o-W to 239.7m units and N2.9bn, respectively. The top traded stocks by volume were Access Bank (159.8m units), Universal Insurance (150.1m units) and Diamond Bank (70.0m units) while Stanbic IBTC (N2.2bn), Nigerian Breweries (N1.2bn) and Nestle (N1.2bn) topped trades by value. The week started off on a negative note as the All Share Index dipped 0.3 per cent due to sell offs in market bellwethers – Dangote Cement, Nigerian Breweries and Guaranty Trust Bank. The negative performance was sustained for three consecutive sessions, declining 1.3 per cent, 0.5 per cent and 1.3 per cent on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, but upturned on Friday with the ASI rising 0.9 per cent, largely due to gains in Dangote Cement (+1 per cent) and Nigerian Breweries (+4.1 per cent). Performance across sectors was mixed as two of five indices advanced while three declined W-o-W.
