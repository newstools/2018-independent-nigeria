Miley Cyrus’ brother Trace is engaged to his girlfriend Taylor Lauren Sanders. The 29-year-old took to Instagram on Thursday (06Dec18) to announce his happy news, by sharing a video of himself and Taylor shortly after he’d asked her to marry him. “Well… It’s official! SHE SAID YES! We’re getting married!” he captioned the post, showing off his bride-to-be’s dazzling engagement ring. “I will love you FOREVER!!! @taylorlaurensanders.” Taylor, who recorded a song with her new fiance called Give My Heart to You in August (18), shared her own joy over the life milestone. “GUYS IM STILL DYING. I can’t believe I get to marry my bestest friend. We’ve been inseparable since day one and now it gets to be that way forever,” she wrote. “I love you so much @tracecyrus you mean the world to me and I’ve been waiting on you forever.
