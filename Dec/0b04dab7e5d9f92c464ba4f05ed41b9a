LAGOS – The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) yesterday stated that the association lost trillions of Naira to the leadership crisis therein in the last five years in the country. Elder Chinedu Okoronkwo, the national president of the association disclosed this at a press conference, following the Supreme Court verdict which declared him and his exco as the bonafide leaders of the marketers association. It would be recalled that Okoronkwo won at the High Court, Appeal Court and Supreme Court judgment against Mr Lawson Obasi over the leadership tussles that lingered for over four years. In an unanimous verdict, the apex court on Friday struck out the appeal of Chief Lawson Obasi in the suit and fined him two million in favour Mr Chinedu Okoronkwo Speaking at the press conference, the IPMAN helmsman said: “We have lost trillions of naira globally in our businesses while many of our members have lost their lives in the last five years because of lack of leadership in IPMAN to coordinate our business within the government circle, NNPC/PPMC, PEF, PPPRA and other stakeholders in the downstream sector. He said that IPMAN is not represented when major policy decisions are being taken to move our businesses forward. He added the setback the association witnessed in the last 5 years in IPMAN members businesses has now become history as the association will henceforth be represented in all statutory board of Federal government agencies to protect her members interest. “However, I will be eternally grateful our National Leader of IPMAN, Board of Trustees of IPMAN members who stood by us in our trying period.”
