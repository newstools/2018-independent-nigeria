Lagos – Villarreal of Spain youngster, Samuel Chukwueze has cast doubt over a transfer link with La Liga giants, Atletico Madrid, as he said he is not sure the former champions are interested in signing him. In contrast with recent widespread reports that Atletico are ready to reel out 40m euros to snatch him from The Yellow Submarine in 2019, Chukwueze is staying focused on playing more for his current team. The Chile 2015 FIFA Under-17 World Cup revelation, however, admitted that he has heard about interest in his contract from some other clubs in Spain, which he said is now up to his manager and Villarreal’s top brass. Chukwueze also confirmed interest from some clubs in the English Premier League (EPL), but stressed that he remains committed to Villarreal. The 19-year-old winger, who has less than seven months on his current deal, admitted that the odds are with Villarreal to either make him sign a new deal in January or make him available for a major transfer. “I have a contract here with Villarreal which expires in the summer and the club knows what to do. “I can confirm to you that there are a few interests from some top English clubs, but on Atletico Madrid, I’m not really sure about that. “So, we will just keep our fingers crossed and see what happens before then. For now, the focus remains (for me) to help the club”, he said.
