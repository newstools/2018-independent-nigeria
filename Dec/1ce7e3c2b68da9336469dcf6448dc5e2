Two quick strikes from Senegalese number nine, Diassy, saw the champions take a 2-0 lead within the opening minutes of their opening match against Nigeria. Try as they might, Nigeria couldn’t find the net before the first whistle, but played well. The first period ended with Nigeria trailing, but they had created some dangerous attacks, including several long-range shots which had to be palmed to safety. The second period began at full throttle, and the men in green were by no means out of this tie. After building the pressure, Ekujumi converted a sublime freekick to half the deficit and Nigeria were right back in this tie, with just a few minutes remaining of the second period. But, just two minutes later, the two-goal advantage was restored as Diange struck for Senegal, who went into the third and final period with a 3-1 lead. Once more Nigeria came back, when a shot was laid off for Taiwo to smash past the keeper, taking the score to 3-2. And then, a fabulous header from Ogbonna saw the number ten make an arching leap to flick the ball into the Senegalese net and complete the comeback for his side. As the third period drew on, the scores remained level at 3-3 and it looked like extra time was a more and more likely outcome. Then, with just two minutes, Taiwo converted once more, and thought he had won it for Nigeria, before the lead was cruelly snatched once again when Barry volleyed in from close range to force extra time. When extra time couldn’t decide the tie, it went to penalties. After Ndoye and Diassy converted twice, and Nigeria were unable to score, Senegal took a single, very hard-fought, point from the penalty spot. Senegal will play Tanzania tomorrow to try and continue their title-defending campaign, while Nigeria will face Libya.
