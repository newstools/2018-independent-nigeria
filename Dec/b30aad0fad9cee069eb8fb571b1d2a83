ASABA – Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, has congratulated Team Delta for winning the just concluded 19th National Sports Festival, Abuja 2018. The State won 352 medals, comprising of 163 gold, 88 silver and 101 bronze medals. Okowa, who attended the festival’s closing ceremony was elated that Team Delta set a record on their way to successfully defending the festival won at the Eko 2012 in Lagos. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Charles Aniagwu on Monday in Asaba, the Governor thanked the Delta State Sports Commission, all team members, coaching crew and supporters for their hard work and dedication which culminated in the victory. According to Okowa, “There is no doubt that sports development is very important in our nation, with all the energy in our youths, they need to be guided in the right direction. “For us as a state government, we believe that the youths must be engaged continually in sports. Sport is a unifying factor for us particularly in Delta State that is multi-ethnic. It also helps the youths to be disciplined.” The Governor urged parents and stakeholders to encourage their children to engage in sports “because of the economic factor involved. “If we are able to get the young ones not just to win laurels for our nation Nigeria but, help themselves and others who are close to them; it is important to put a lot of money into sports development because of the benefits and I am glad we encouraged the athletes to win more laurels with various cash gifts we promised them. “Our administration is inspired to invest in sports development by the achievements recorded by previous administrations in the state as well as that of General Samuel Ogbemudia when he was the Governor of the defunct Bendel State,” he added.
