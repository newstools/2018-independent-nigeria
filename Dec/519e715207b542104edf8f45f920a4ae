The girl began having seizures eight hours after she was taken into custody by Border Patrol agents, according to DHS. Paramedics determined she had a 105.7-degree fever and she was airlifted to a hospital in El Paso, Texas, where she went into cardiac arrest. She was revived, DHS said, but did not recover. She died at the hospital less than 24 hours later, DHS said. She and her father were traveling in a large group and were about 90 miles away from the processing point, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in an interview Friday morning on Fox News. Border Patrol agents had to make repeated attempts to round up the group, Nielsen said, and gave immediate care.
