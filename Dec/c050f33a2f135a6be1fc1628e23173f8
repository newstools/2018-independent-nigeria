The Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) on Monday advised the media to pay more attention to politicians with issue-based campaigns and shun those that embarked on negative campaigns. The Guild, in a communique issued at its Standing Committee meeting held in Bauchi state on Dec. 15, enjoined journalists to abide by the Media Code on Election Coverage. The communique, signed by NGE president, Mrs Funke Egbemode and secretary-general, Victoria Ibanga, reiterated that it was imperative for the media to abide by the Media Code on Election Coverage. “Having noted with dismay, the emerging trend of dwelling on inanities and calumny, the Nigerian Guild of Editors enjoin the media to pay more attention to politicians who campaign on issues and shun those who smear their opponents or embark on negative campaigns. “Recognising their pivotal role in the election process, the Guild advises journalists to abide by the Media Code on Election Coverage and ensure balanced reportage, fairness to all and display a high sense of  professionalism at the same time,’’ it said. The communique also enjoined INEC to conduct a free, fair and credible election, adding that its loyalty must be to the nation alone and not to any political party. The Guild, who also decried the growing phenomenon of vote-buying, reminded the electorate of the need for them not to mortgage their future for immediate pecuniary gains. “Election is not a do-or-die affair, as the survival of the country is of paramount importance to all,’’ it said. The Guild thanked the government and people of Bauchi state for hosting the last quarterly meeting of the standing committee for 2018. It also commended the Bauchi state government for its sustained infrastructural development within the last three years.
