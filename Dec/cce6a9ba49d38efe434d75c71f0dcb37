UYO – A community-based health insurance group, Ukana West 2, has appealed to Akwa Ibom State governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, to give assent to the Akwa Ibom Health Insurance Agency bill already passed into law by the state house of assembly. He explained that the bill was passed into law in June 2018 by the House of Assembly but still awaiting the assent of Governor Udom Emmanuel. He said it was “a sign in the positive direction; however is that the state government had made a budgetary provision of N600 million for the scheme.” During a press conference in collaboration with National Health Insurance Scheme as part of activities making the 2018 Universal Health Coverage day which began yesterday, Chairman Board of Trustees of the association, Mr. Michael Akpabio said the governor’s assent to the bill would boost the activities of the organisation. Such assent, Akpabio said would also ensure compulsory health coverage for the entire state; capturing both formal and informal sectors. “Universal health Coverage is a political choice to strive for equity and justice in Health. We commend Akwa Ibom state House of Assembly for considering and passing into law the Akwa Ibom Health Insurance Agency bill. “We call on Udom Gabriel Emmanuel, the executive governor of Akwa Ibom state to give his assent to the law for the benefit of the masses of Akwa Ibom state. “World leaders have agreed that every person; no matter who they are, where they live, or how much they have, should be able to access quality health services without suffering financial hardship. “To achieve this vision of Universal Health Coverage by 2030, there is the need to galvanise collective action now to build strong, equitable health system in the state.
