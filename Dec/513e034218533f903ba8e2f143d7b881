The Nigerian Employers ’Consultative Association (NECA) yesterday urged the Federal Government to expedite action in the process of transmitting the national minimum wage bill to the National Assembly (NASS) within the shortest possible time to avert another strike. Dr. Mohammed Yinusa, the President of NECA, who made the declaration during NECA’s quarterly press briefing on issues that are crucial to business survival and growth of the economy, also argued that since the process of arriving at a national minimum wage had culminated in the submission of the recommendations of the tripartite committee to the President, speedy passage of the bill would avoid threats to the nation’s industrial harmony. Recall that labour unions had called on President Muhammadu Buhari to take urgent steps to address the lingering issue on the new national minimum wage by immediately forwarding an executive bill to the National Assembly to legalise the recommendation of the tripartite Committee. President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Ayuba Wabba said Nigerian workers were running out of patience with the government over the delay and they were getting more and more agitated. Yinusa explained that NECA believed the issue of ability to pay may not be as worrisome as often presented if there is efficiency, effectiveness and prudence in the administration of the governance structure. He described the N30,000 recommended minimum wage figure as a fair wage that could lift workers purchasing power, increase total demand and ultimately stimulate the economic activities. According to him, on the need for the implementation of the recommended N30,000 wage, national conversation should be focused on how to broaden the nation’s revenue base, ensure the viability of the states of the federation, eliminate wastages and rent seeking in all spheres of national life.
