Okpekpe international 10km road race promoter, Mike Itemuagbor, has congratulated the Minister for Sports, Solomon Dalung on the organisation of the 19th National Sports Festival which ended on Sunday. Itemuagbor says the Minister displayed uncommon courage to go ahead with the organisation of the event that suffered several postponements between 2014 and the most part of 2018. “I commend your courage and wisdom in reviving the only event that brings all Nigerians together, ‘Itemuagbor said in a statement on Monday. The Okpekpe race organiser is not unaware that events are becoming larger and somewhat more costly in terms of resources required to host them but the inherent advantages in terms of the development of athletes and the unity it engenders must have informed Dalung’s decision to brave all the financial odds. “This is why I am particularly happy the minister spared no expense to make sure the event was held and the greatest beneficiary is not just the athletes and the officials but Nigeria.
