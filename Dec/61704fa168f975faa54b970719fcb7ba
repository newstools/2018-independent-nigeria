It appears that Amazon Prime members no longer have the option for ‘No Rush’ delivery in return for a digital credit. One of the key benefits of the Prime programme for many was the option to have their packages sent out slightly later at a presumed reduced cost for Amazon and in return they’d get £1 credited to their account that could be redeemed against digital order. We’ve spoken to Amazon and they have confirmed that No Rush deliveries are no longer an Amazon service which will be a disappointment to many who have made use of that delivery option and received the benefit to date. When asked whether the benefit change is permanent, an Amazon representative told us “Yes, we have removed permanently removed.” Amazon is still a great source of deals, but this will be one reason for a lot of customers to be unhappy.
