LAGOS – First vice-president of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Barrister Seyi Akinwunmi is worried about the ongoing face-off between the leaders of the Nigerian National League (NNL) and the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). The Lagos State Football Association (LSFA) chairman on Monday admitted that is fear is about the possibility of another stalemate in the country’s football circle if the face-off is not nib in the mud. He has therefore sued for pace among the feuding leaders of the top leagues in the country, in order to avoid a return to crisis in the sector. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that with clubs in the NNL insisting on promoting eight teams to the upper echelon, the NPFL, Akinwunmi said it is a case of unwanted discord. Akinwunmi described the present scenario as a semblance of what happened earlier in the year, regarding crisis that engulfed the NFF. Akinwunmi recounted: “The battle in the leadership of the federation impacted adversely and negative on Nigerian football. “Now we are facing a similar situation. We just have to call on football stakeholders to learn from the mistakes of the past. “We must all reset our ways of thinking going forward, because we cannot afford to let another period of crises slow Nigeria down.” It is however not clear what the leadership of the NFF will do to the ongoing crisis as both the leaders of the NPFL and the NNL are hell bent on not shifting grounds. The purported Play-off directed by the NFF failed to hold as only three teams out of the eight reported for the matches, which failed not hold.
