Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday there were positive developments on the case of Turkeyâ€™s state-owned lender Halkbank, adding that Ankara hoped for a positive outcome on the case. Earlier on Friday, state-owned Anadolu news agency reported that prosecutors in New York had withdrawn an appeal to extend the 32-month sentence of former Halkbank (HALKB.IS) executive Hakan Atilla, who had been convicted for helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions in a case that strained ties between the NATO allies. Erdogan was speaking to reporters in Istanbul after Friday prayers.
