LAGOS – Uncertainty over the resumption date of the Nigeria Professional Football League heightened during the week, as a result of the boycott of the Nigeria National League (NNL) playoffs. The fate of the league, which was postponed indefinitely weeks ago, is worst off as the eight clubs expected to play the NNL playoffs where four teams will qualify to play in the league have all pulled out . The playoffs are billed for the Enyimba International Stadium in Aba and trhe Umuahia Township Stadium. The clubs expected in the playoffs are Remo Stars, Shooting Stars, Bendel Insurance and Delta Force, who qualified for the playoffs from the Southern Conference. The Northern Conference qualifiers are Gombe United, Real Stars, Kada Stars, and Kogi United. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that the clubs action was in solidarity with Bukola Oladape, the chief executive officer of the NNL, who resigned his appointment earlier in the week citing interference from the leadership of the NPFL. It has been gathered that the leadership of the NPFL were allegedly mounting pressure on Oladape to go ahead with the proposed Super 8 from where four teams would have joined the NPFL, even as club owners in the lower cadre insisted on eight teams progressing. However, DAILY INDEPENDENT’s call to Aba to confirm the pullout proved real as the respondent, who declined to comment, said that there was no sign that the Super 8, which would have started today (December 14), would still go on as planned. Meanwhile, neither the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) nor the League Management Company (LMC) officials were willing to comment on the issue but a player from the Peoples Elephants, who equally declined to be mentioned, berated the authorities for their lack of vision in managing football league.
