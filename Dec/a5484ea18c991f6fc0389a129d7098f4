LAGOS – Despite losing 2-0 to the Junior Teranga Lions of Senegal in the final of the West African Football Union (WAFU) U20 tournament, ex-international, Taiwo Oloyede believes the Flying Eagles will excel at next year’s African U-20 Cup of Nations in Niger. Reviewing the draw ceremony which pitched Nigeria alongside South Africa, host Niger and Burundi in Group A, Oloyede said that with solid preparations and determination, the Flying Eagles would scale through the group and go on to qualify for the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland. Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Mali will compete in Group B of the championship, which is scheduled to run from February 2 to 16 in two Niger Republic cities of Niamey and Maradi. The top four teams, all semi-finalists, will qualify for the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland. “It is good draw for Nigeria and I am optimistic that with good preparations and determination from the players, Nigeria will scale through the group and go on to pick one of the tickets for the World Cup. “Coach Frank Aigbogun has good players and all needed to be done is adequate preparations with support from the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF),” he said.
