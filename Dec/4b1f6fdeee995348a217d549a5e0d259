DUTSE – Sheikh Muhammad Yahaya Jingir, the leader of Jamaatu Izalatil Bidah Wa Ikamatus Sunnah, has pleaded with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to rescind the decision to embark on the planned nationwide strike action. Jingir, who made the plea during the closing of the national camping and appeal fund launch, which was held at the Mallam Aminu Kano Triangle in Dutse, said the strike action might bring about more hardship than respite to the public. The JIBWIS leader said the NLC ought to have considered that many Nigerians were not employed and were patiently praying for their turn to come. He said, “I’m not saying that the labour union doesn’t have the right to demand increase in workers’ salaries, however, they ought to also consider that many more Nigerians that have other rights in the system that are not employed are waiting patiently at home.” He added, “Nigerians have the right to jobs but when that is not forthcoming, they should look inward and create opportunities for themselves through farming.” The leader also charged the Federal Government to create the enabling environment for dialogue over the new minimum wage being advocated by the NLC and other Nigerians. He then called on the electorate to scrutinise those seeking for elective offices and settle for the ones that have the fear of Allah, are sincere and ‎committed to nation building.
