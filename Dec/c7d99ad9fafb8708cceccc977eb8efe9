They are enjoying the festive season at their multi-million pound holiday cottage in Cornwall. And ahead of his famous Christmas Day roast dinner, Gordon Ramsay forced his kids to swim in the freezing cold Atlantic Ocean to work up an appetite on Tuesday. The Michelin-starred chef, 52, took to Instagram to share a snap of his son Jack, 18, and daughter Tilly, 17, delightedly taking a photo of his children shivering after plunging into the icy waters. He captioned the post: ‘Christmas Day Crazy’s quick swim no wetsuit required, working up an appetite #polzeath.’ After a delicious meal Gordon, who is known for his love of fitness, joined his wife Tana, Jack and daughters Tilly,17,  Megan, 20, and Holly, 18 for a family selfie. The television personality and Jack donned grey pyjamas while the girls rocked matching tartan pj’s. The Ramsays then headed outside to watch the sunset over the sea after their Christmas meal with all the trimmings. Tana revealed recently that their family just can’t get enough of Cornwall. She said: ‘It’s the place where I see Gordon truly relax, and the lack of a phone signal is an absolute blessing. ‘He has always had an obsession with the sea, and spends hours fishing or just sitting on the dunes. ‘Our children take a dinghy and sit in the estuary and have fun. It’s all nice and healthy.’ Gordon bought the former Lloyds bank on Fore Street for £2million, with plans to transform it into a residential home. Planning permission was sought to turn the grade two-listed property into a four-bedroom home, although the ground floor was reserved for retail use. The hot-tempered chef has spent more than £10million on property in Cornwall since 2015, including the former bank in Fore Street, Fowey. He’s currently building a multi-million pound home at Rock, near Padstow – nicknamed ‘Padstein’ because another TV chef, Rick Stein, owns many properties there.
