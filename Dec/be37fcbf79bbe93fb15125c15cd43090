ABAKALIKI – The people of Ezza Ezekunna popularly known as Ezza Nation in Ebonyi State have unveiled activities to formally honour Mr. Emmanuel Igwe, the publisher of National Issue Newspaper, a popular local tabloid in the state. The Ezzas domiciled in almost all the 13 council areas of the state will on December 30th confer a chieftaincy title on Igwe for standing on the side of truth during the Ezza/ Ezzilo communal clash which had been resolved by current administration of Governor David Umahi. According to information obtained by IDAILY NDEPENDENT, the journalist merited the chieftaincy title also because of his contributions towards eradicating financial corruption through investigative journalism. DAILY INDEPENDENT recalls that National Issue Newspaper was one of the local newspapers in the state that were in the forefront of offering constructive criticism to the policies and programmes of the immediate past administration of Chief Martin Elechi especially as it concerned the handling of the Ezza/Ezillo communal clash. The event which will hold at the Agbaugama Central School, Ezekuna Community, Ezzagu, in Ishielu Local Government Area of the state will attract dignitaries from all walks of life.
