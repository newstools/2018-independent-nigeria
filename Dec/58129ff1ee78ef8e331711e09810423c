Lagos – Yoon Deok-yeo, the coach of South Korea women national team, has said that the Super Falcons of Nigeria should not be ignored ahead of their meeting at the 2019 FIFA Women World Cup in France. Nigeria will open their account against former winners, Norway, before facing the Asians, who will come up against the host nation in their opening fixture. Consequently, Deok-yeo has declared that the most sensitive match for his team will be that second game against Nigeria, as it could mark their progress or exit in the competition. Deok-yeo reckoned that anything could happen when they face the hosts, such that the next fixture against Nigeria might be very crucial before their last group tie against Norway. Local media reports that the Korean gaffer is thinking big for all three group matches with a view that his team could hold their own against the hosts, the nine time African champions and the ex-World Cup winners respectively in that order. Korea’s biggest danger is in attack, where Chelsea ace, Ji So-yun, plays in the hunt for goals, alongside Cho So-hyun, from Avaldsnes IL in Norway. In order to qualify for the last sixteen at France 2019, Deok-yeo disclosed that their plan was to beat Nigeria at Stade des Alpes, Grenoble, then see what they would get out of another tricky game against the Norwegians. ”The second match against Nigeria will be crucial and we will have to win and then play the decisive match against Norway. ”Norway and Nigeria cannot be ignored. Norway is a strong team that has already won a World Cup, and Nigeria has qualified for its eighth consecutive World Cup finals.”
