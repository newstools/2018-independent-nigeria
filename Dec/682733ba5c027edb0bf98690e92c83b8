ENUGU – The Federal Ministry Of Science And Technology has announced Enugu State as the host of the third edition of its science, technology and innovation EXPO. Ogbonna Onu, the Minister of Science and Technology, announced this at a press conference in Enugu over the weekend. According to Onu, the EXPO with the theme; “Science, Technology and Innovation for Economic Recovery and Sustainable Growth,” is slated to hold from January 14th to 18th, 2019. Onu stated that the purpose of the event is to diversify the nation’s economy and tackle unemployment. “We are here to hear from you, what we should do to make this 2019 EXPO a successful one, in order to build the economy of the country. “We chose Enugu State as the venue because we had the first and second EXPOs at Eagle Square Abuja and decided to have it outside the square to allow every zone to contribute to economic development. “The purpose of this EXPO is to diversify the economy of the country and reduce unemployment in the country,” he said. Onu promised that inventors and innovators that had done a series of research based on the recent technology and developed it into products, should be available to make sure that the EXPO is a successful one. He called on institutions, inventors, entrepreneurs and researchers to participate in the EXPO 2019, stating that it would, in the end, reduce the rate of unemployment in the country. “You are expected to convert your research findings into products as countries who had declared an interest, will storm the venue,” Minister said. In a vote of thanks, Enugu States commissioner for science and technology, Engr Patrick Ikpenwa, commended Hon, Ogbonnaya Onu for his choice of Enugu state to host the event and urged the masses to come and showcase their talents in science and technology to move the country forward.
