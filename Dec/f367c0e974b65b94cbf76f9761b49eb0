Lagos – Coach of Lobi Stars FC, Nigeria’s representatives in the CAF Champions League, Solomon Ogbeide is upbeat on the chances of the team going far in the competition. Though pitched against one of the storied teams from the Eastern part of Africa in Gor Mahia of Kenya, Ogbeide said Lobi Stars can ride their luck in the Round 1/16th fixtures billed for Friday, December 14 in Kenya. Edged out at the mini-league stage of the Champions league on their continental cup debut in 2000, Ogbeide on his second spell with Lobi Stars said they have acquired valuable experiences over the years. “Of course, we know that Gor Mahia is a very big club from Kenya but the business between a big team and a small team is the match on the field of play and Lobi Stars is also a big team,” Ogbeide said. According to him, Lobi have the pedigree to give Nigeria good representation at the competition this time around. “We have represented Nigeria in this same competition before and we are not leaving any stone unturned as we prepare for this match against Gor Mahia on Friday. While the East African side is celebrating their Golden Jubilee this year with a record 17 Kenyan Premier League titles and one African Cup Winners’ Cup under their belt but Ogbeide is not worried that the 37-year-old Lobi Stars sneaked into the continental fray this term when they were declared winners of the inconclusive Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). “We just need good preparation to scale through after the two legs. “No matter what anyone would say, we consider ourselves worthy champions of the NPFL because we occupied the first position to be declared winners and we proved this was not a fluke when we won the Nigeria Super Cup by defeating Rangers International,” Ogbeide asserted.
