Lagos – Victor Agali, the Super Eagles chief scout, has advised Coach Gernot Rohr against further invitation of untested players of Nigerian descent, explaining that only very few players were required to shore up the national team in the areas of need. It will be remembered that over the couple of years, Rohr has scouted Europe for players of Nigerian origin, as he builds a team for the future. The process has since seen the introduction of Bryan Idowu, Tyronne Ebuehi and Ola Aina, all of whom have now earned international caps with Nigeria, but Victor Agali has advised the coaches to pump the breaks. Agali, who spoke to Brila FM, said that only a few players were currently required to shore up areas of need in the team, and that there would be no need for an influx of players. He said that with the players in camp, Nigeria could face the best in the continent, noting that further invitation might hinder the cohesion already achieved in the team. After missing two previous editions, Nigeria will make a return to Africa’s foremost football competition and are expected to put up a good showing. So many Nigerians believe that at least a semifinal finish won’t be asking too much from the team.
