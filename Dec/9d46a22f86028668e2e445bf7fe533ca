The UK Government has urged all Nigerian political parties to take a stand to commit to sustainable efforts on human development ahead of the 2019 general elections. The UK made the call in a statement from the Department for International Development (DFID) made available by Mr David Smith, Head of Communications and Policy and Corporate Lead in Abuja on Friday. The statement is coming ahead of the National Dialogue on Human Capital Development aimed to bring together high-level global stakeholders with an interest in developing the human capital. The Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, would address the dialogue in the State House Conference Hall on Friday, alongside the Head of DFID Nigeria, Debbie Palmer. Palmer, according to the statement, stressed the importance of all Nigerians working together to make an impact in the development of the country. She said: “I cannot understate the importance of a national focus on Human Development. “Nigeria’s growing, young population offers a unique opportunity for the country to flourish into the powerhouse of Africa. “That cannot happen if we do not work together, and make a real impact in healthcare, education and other key areas.” The spokesperson for DFID Nigeria said there was no “quick fix” for the challenges the country was currently facing. “All political parties need to take a stand ahead of the 2019 elections, and commit to sustainable efforts on Human Development. “We hope this National Dialogue will be the spark that ignites the interest and social discourse required to deliver real, lasting change, and make Nigeria fit for the future.” The National Dialogue would be an opportunity to highlight the importance of focusing on Human Development, particularly as the 2019 elections draw close. It would also offer a platform for government to renew its efforts and partners to deliver lasting impact in the country.
