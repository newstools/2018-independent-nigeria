Dosu Joseph, former Super Eagles goalkeeper, has asked Gernot Rohr to build a solid team in preparation for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations holding in either South Africa of Egypt. He made the call against the backdrop of the team’s return to the continental championship after missing the last two editions. Nigeria qualified for the tournament with a game to spare following the team’s 1-1 draw against South Africa in Johannesburg last November. Dosu , who believes  Super Eagles are good enough to win the title for the fourth time, called on the coach to invite more players to help build a more solid team for the Nations Cup. According to him, Nigeria are one of the favoured teams to win the Nations Cup, noting that the likes of Egypt, Senegal, Morocco and Cameroon were among teams considered to be ahead in the race for the continental crown nest year.
