Lagos – Chief Adegboyega Onigbinde,  former Super Eagles coach, has slammed 19th National Sports Festival (NSF) that kicks off today in Abuja as not only a mere jamboree, but that the aim of the festival has been defeated. The Festival (NSF) will start today at the National Stadium Abuja with over 10,000 athletes and officials. Onigbinde told DAILY INDEPENDENT on Wednesday that, “The fact that Nigeria is not in any way developing her sports means that the Festival has turned to a mere jamboree. “The National Sports Festival among its objectives is aimed at discovering athletes for the nation; the athletes are discovered from the grassroots – primary and secondary schools. “Now, do we have the sports facilities in our schools today? What about the coaches that should come from the schools – the Teachers Training Colleges as it were – the Physical Education (PE) teaches? If all of these are absent today would one say Nigeria is developing sports? Onigbinde mindful of the importance of sports to the development of the youths in the society said that it was an aberration for the authorities to have allowed the festival go on a long break without holding. “Is not a shame that for over six years the festival could not hold? It is said that an idle mind is the devil’s workshop; yet, sport is something that should be used to take the youths away from the street – it can gainfully employ thousands of youths – why then should any serious government not provide the facilities for it to be working?” He reiterated,“As far as I’m concerned the Festival is a jamboree, because it has outlived its usefulness.” The festival which was initially billed for Cross River State, who withdrew owing to lack of funds, will come to end on December 16, 2018.
