LAGOS – With the Super Eagles of Nigeria having qualified for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) even with a match at hand, coach of the team, Gernot Rohr plans to play at least three build-up matches ahead of the tournament. Though the coach had earlier planned to play five matches, three games may now appear more feasible. According to Rohr, the team’s last qualifier against Seychelles will also be part of his build-up programme. Rohr, who has already picked Uyo as the Super Eagles’ training base for AFCON, said that he hopes the match would hold in Uyo to kick-start his countdown to the continental showpiece. “Besides the match against Seychelles in March, we hope to play three more friendlies – one in March and some at the end of May.” “We hope and pray that the matches will help to shape up the players ahead of AFCON and other major competitions,” he said. Nigeria picked the AFCON ticket after the 1-1 draw played against the Bafana Bafana of South Africa in Johannesburg with the match at hand against Seychelles. Nigeria tops the Group table with 10 points and followed by South Africa while Libya sits on the third position with Seychelles at the rear of the table. The first two teams at the end of the group matches would qualify for the AFCON 2019 at a yet to be named venue.
