Leicester Coach, Claud Puel and team’s defender, Wilfred Ndidi are worried over the poor form of the team’s striker, Kelechi Iheanacho. Iheanacho has looked short of confidence in his recent performances for Leicester City in place of the injured Jamie Vardy. Ndidi is, however, supporting the Nigerian to come through a difficult period in his career. Ndidi admits he doesn’t know what is going on in Iheanacho’s head but believes he just needs more support to get back to his best. “I think so [short of confidence], but I think playing will give him more confidence,” said Ndidi. “He is trying to do his best and he is training and doing well. “I really don’t know. I really honestly don’t know what is going on but I think he is going to get back to it yeah. “But for the injury we know what Vardy can do up front, but at the moment if Kelechi is in nobody can decide. “I think we just need a little support up front and a little talk and a little motivation to actually make him do better.” Manager Claude Puel has also expressed worry at his performance but still believes he has what it takes to excel at the club. Iheanacho missed a one-on-one in the opening minutes at Fulham and Puel believes had that chance gone in Iheanacho would have kicked on. “Perhaps just after his chance he had a lack of confidence but I have confidence in him,” he said. “He has quality and has a great left foot. He can be clinical but last game there was not enough in our game to give him chances. “It is not just an offensive problem, it is all the team need to play more with more intensity to play forward and find more solutions in the top half of the pitch. “I have confidence in him and I am sure he will show his quality. “We work together and we do training sessions to improve in front of goal.
