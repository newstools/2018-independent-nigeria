Edo State government has mobilised women at the grassroots across the state to lend their voices against gender-based violence, urging them to speak up against the menace. Speaking during a rally organised by the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development, held in Oria, Esan South East Local Government Area, Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Hon. Magdalene Ohenhen, said the charge was necessary as there would be structures to protect the vulnerable in the society. She said the rally was organised by the ministry as part of activities lined up for the 2018 International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, themed ‘Hear Me Too.’ Participants at the rally included chairpersons and presiding officers of the ministry in the different local government areas. The commissioner stressed that the time had come for women who were victims of gender-based violence to come out of the closet and speak up instead of suffering in silence. She commended Governor Godwin Obaseki and his wife, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki, for their support, adding that the idea behind the crusade was to ensure that women, as home builders, live in safer homes. Guest Speaker, Ambassador Chief (Mrs.) Marian Kadiri Ezolome, explained that violence against women, which might be physical, emotional or psychological, included rape, defilement, child marriage, human trafficking, among others. She urged women to do away with the culture of silence arising from fear and stigmatisation, noting that keeping silent would cause them more harm than good.
