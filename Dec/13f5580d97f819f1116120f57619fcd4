LAGOS – The governorship candidate of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) in Lagos State, Chief Owolabi Salis, yesterday said he would transform and re-define governance in Lagos if voted as the governor. Salis said this while on tour of the Ilaje community, in Bariga area of the state. He also reinstated his commitment to the development of the grassroots, as well as empowerment of the youths. Salis said he was ready to work with people to transform the state, having taken time to brainstorm and develop a master plan that would make it one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The guber candidate further said he had been part of the Ilaje community since the late 70’s and chose to re-assess the environment. According to him, there is need to know why things are yet to change in terms of amenities in the Ilaje, as well as other communities in the state. “The neighbourhood lacks basic amenities and it has been a neglected neighbourhood; I personally came to assess the community myself. “Also, for those youths involved in violence, I want to advise them to make themselves available for a better life,” the governorship candidate said. Salis said that he would look into the neighbourhood formation, education system and ensure drastic reduction in the level of violence.
