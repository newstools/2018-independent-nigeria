Yola – The former Chief of Naval Staff and one time Governor of Adamawa State, Admiral Murtala Nyako, has said that the All Progressive Congress (APC) will suffer defeat in many states because of injustice, impunity and the growing number of aggrieved people within the party at 2019 general elections. Nyako, who arrived Adamawa State after a brief stint in a foreign country on medical checkup, said APC was the party of the ordinary people but injustices, unresolved aggrieved situations, impunity and lack of respect for the wishes of the people could cost it victory in many states. He said, “The party neglected all cogent advice given to it at the top level and so many people are today so aggrieved in all the states such that making them to change their minds is difficult and this may cost the party victory in many states.” He said since the party does not want to abandon impunity and injustices, complaints and aggressive protests are bound to affect its fortunes at the polls next year. He said the problems of the APC started during the ward, local government areas and states congresses where injustices and impunity gave birth to double congresses across the country and the lack of transparent primaries brought serious cracks into the party and APC is no longer the same. He said if APC had listened to the words of wisdom from elders and conducted the ward congresses LGAs congresses and states based on democratic tenets “we would not have such serious aggrieved population in APC now. The APC chieftain said all efforts to rescue the party are almost slipping away by the day and elections are just by the corner therefore it will be difficult to find amicable resolutions to all the aggrieved parties in the party who have fundamental issues against the conduct of its primaries, ward, LGA and states congresses. Nyako, who has a cult-like following across Adamawa State and the North-East said the party refused to accept sound advice which has now put the party at war against itself.
