One Direction definitely have a move for getting the Kardashian sisters’ attention. Liam Payne seems to have followed in Zayn Malik’s footsteps after he liked Kylie Jenner’s Insta-pic when he was newly single after his split from Perrie Edwards – but Liam has gone one step further. The singer, who recently split from Cheryl, made his admiration for Kourtney Kardashian very clear when he left a comment on a particularly raunchy snap she’d posted to Instagram.
Kourtney, who has three children with ex Scott Disick, shared a behind-the-scenes photo of her looking sexy in lingerie on a photo shoot, so Liam commented, ‘Wow’. Fans went wild for the exchange, with the singer’s comment racking up over 3,000 likes. But unfortunately, Liam may be sorely disappointed – as Kourtney is rumoured to be dating 21-year-old model Luka Sabbat. The flirty exchange comes after Liam’s split from Cheryl, with who he has a one-year-old son Bear. The pair were together for two and a half years, but announced the break-up earlier this year. In July, the former 1D bandmate tweeted, “Cheryl and I are sad to announce that we are going our separate ways. “It’s been a tough decision for us to make. We still have so much love for each other as a family. Bear is our world and we ask that you respect his privacy as we navigate our way through this together.” The singer, who recently made her comeback with a performance on The X Factor, also shared the joint statement with her followers.
