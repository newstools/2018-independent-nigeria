ADO-EKITI – Fresh hostility is brewing between the Ogoga of Ikere, Oba Adejimi Adu Alagbado and the Olukere ,Ganiyu Obaspyin over the latter’s quest to gain recognition as a monarch in the town . The latest crisis was sequel to a recent visit to Governor Kayode Fayemi,who urged him to expedite action and accord him recognition as a substantive monarch . Olukere claimed that he had fulfilled the requirement laid down by the government to be so accorded the status .Obasoyin also claimed to have rich and verifiable historical facts to back his position . However ,Ogoga also led a delegation to the Deputy Governor to refute his (Obasoyin’s) claim to kingship in the town. Oba Adejimi implored the government to reject the request of the Olukere to be recognized as a traditional ruler in Ikere Ekiti. Besides, the Princes of Ikere Kingdom ,acting under the aegis of the Council of Omo Owas maintained that Obasoyin’s aspiration for official recognition as a monarch was “baseless, untenable and not supported by history, fact, law and reality.” At a press brief in Ado-Ekiti on Tuesday, the Council of Omo Owas argued that the Obasoyin’s claim to royalty was not supported by the reports of the Morgan Commission of 1981, the Augustine Adebayo Commission of 1987 and the Ekiti Council of Traditional Rulers of 2014. According to them, historical records and Intelligent Reports between 1901 and 1936 showed that the Oloje (Olukere) was “described as chief priest of Olosunta” and never an Oba in Ikere. Members of the Council of Omo Owas, who addressed journalists included Prince Peter Adepoju, Prince Ebenezer Giwa, Prince Abioye Ojo and Prince Ezekiel Adesuyi.
