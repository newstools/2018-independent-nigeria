Organizers of the 19th National Sports Festival have declared open Accreditation of Media Professionals interested in reporting the NSF holding in Abuja from 6th to 16th December. Interested journalists are immediately requested to forward their names and relevant professional information to the Chairmen of the various State Chapters of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN). According to the Chairman Accreditation of the Main Organizing Committee, Dr Emmanuel Igbinosa, interested applicants will be screened by their various State Chapters for proper identification with the final list forwarded to the Media and Publicity Sub Committee for final ratification and accreditation. “The portal for the Media Accreditation is now open, but journalists will be accredited based on verification by their various State Chairmen to ensure that the limited spaces available are fully maximized.” With the limited media spaces at the various games venues, Dr Igbinosa said the Media and Publicity Sub Committee will deal directly with the various 37 State SWAN Chairmen while registration will be based on first come first served rule.
