Yenagoa – Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State has lambasted the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) for allegedly doing nothing in the state and in Niger Delta. Dickson said in Yenagoa that the commission had been enmeshed in unnecessary politics, and had abdicated its mandate to ameliorate the socio-economic conditions of communities in the region. According to him, the NDDC had been turned to a political platform by politicians who were using it to dispense political patronage. He said the commission was established with the objective of aiding the development of the Niger Delta, but that it was doing nothing about the region and devoting its energy to politics. The governor said: “NDDC is doing nothing. They are not even around to plan anything with anybody. “Everything is just politics to them. When they started, they were doing one or two things, but now they do nothing.” It would be recalled that Dickson, in 2015, set up a committee to review projects being executed by the NDDC in Bayelsa State. He had explained, while receiving the interim report of the committee in May 2015 that the objective was to ascertain if Bayelsa was getting its fair share from the intervention agency. “This state must be in a position to determine whether we are getting our fair share of NDDC intervention funds. “Secondly, we are also interested in seeing to it that those who are selected by the NDDC as contractors to execute intervention jobs in Bayelsa actually do so. “That is why this committee was put together, and I appreciate the painstaking job you have done,” Dickson stated.
