Eucharia Ogbukwo, a 2018 National Sports Festival (NSF) shot put gold medalist, says is excited throwing shot put. Ogbukwo said this on Monday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. According to her, I love throwing the iron because I have always considered myself strong for the sport. “I choose shot put because I love it with passion and it excites me. I have always known that I am a very strong lady from childhood. I just love to throw the iron. “Though, a lot of people have told me to consider Discus and Hammer but I don’t really have passion for it,” she said. Ogbukwo who threw 15.42m at the NSF said that her target for the 2019 season was to make the standard for the All African Games and also win a medal if selected. The Mathematics graduate from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN) said that she wished that shot putters would be given more recognition. The athlete who placed fifth at the 2018 Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) championships in Asaba said that her major obstacle was finance.
