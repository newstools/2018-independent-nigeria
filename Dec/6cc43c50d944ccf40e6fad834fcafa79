It took just days for the brightly colored Mandarin duck that appeared suddenly in a Central Park pond to turn both New Yorkers and visitors into a new gaggle: the quackarazzi. A horde of photographers has been gathering daily in the park off Fifth Avenue for well over a month, hoping to catch a glimpse of the exotic bird with pink, purple, orange and emerald green plumage and markings that admirer Joe Amato compares to “a living box of crayons.” “So many people are drawn to this bird because its vibrant, vivid colors are associated with sunsets and rainbows,” says Amato, who comes almost daily from his Queens home with his expensive camera equipment in tow. Bird lovers and sightseers have dutifully documented the bird’s every move through social media postings and videos that have noted its gentle glides across the water, its sniping at the ordinary mallards and even a vacation, of sorts, to a lake in nearby New Jersey. This week, New York’s latest rising star didn’t disappoint – with the feathery showboat preening its wings in the shadow of the historic Plaza Hotel as people on shore jostled for a better look. Leesa Beckmann commuted two and a half hours from her home in Vernon Township, New Jersey, to see the duck that her 90-year-old mother has been talking about since its arrival.
