LOKOJA – To stem the tide of road crashes during the ember months, the Corps Marshal General, Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi, has established 241 mobile courts across the country to try traffic offenders, and also commissioned the Multi-Million Sector Command’s office in Lokoja, Kogi State capital, on Monday. According to Oyeyemi, the courts would dispense justice to all irrespective of status. He warned drivers to desist from indulging in alcohol and other substances capable of influencing abnormal behaviour. “If you drink, don’t drive and if you drive, don’t drink”, the Corps Marshal emphasised. Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, who commissioned the edifice, commended the FRSC for the accelerated construction and, therefore, promised to furnish the offices. He said the people of the state had benefited immensely from the services of FRSC, which he noted, had reduced road accidents in the state. The governor, while commending the Corps Marshal General for his foresight, urged officers and men of the command to develop maintenance culture so as to sustain the structure. Chairman of FRSC Board, Buhari Bello, thanked both the Federal and Kogi state governments for the provision of fund and the land, which led to the actualisation of the project located at Zariage, Okene Road, Lokoja.
