Lagos – Coach Gernot Rohr is not leaving any stone unturned in his quest to challenge for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, as DAILY INDEPENDENT can report that the former Girondins Bordeaux of France manager is insisting on playing friendly matches with African oppositions whom the team would play against at the AFCON. The Franco-German coach said, while responding to a question on his plans for the team ahead of the continental showpiece in a monitored programme, that since the Africa Cup of Nations is a competition meant only for Africans, it was imperative that Nigeria concentrate on playing oppositions around the continent. He said that he was not against engaging top European countries for the team, but admitted that playing African countries would put the Super Eagles in good stead to confront the rest of the teams when the Cup of Nations starts. “We are still finalizing our plans for the Cup of Nations but you know we still have one match (against Seychelles) to play in the qualifiers. After that, we will see where we are going. “But I will prefer we play more of top African teams because they are also the same teams we will play against in the competition. Top European countries are okay but we need to engage more African teams for our preparations for the Cup of Nation,” he said.
