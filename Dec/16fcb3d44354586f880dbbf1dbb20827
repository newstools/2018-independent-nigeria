The Federal Government has renewed its commitment to strengthening national security architecture and addressing unemployment challenges bedeviling the country. The Minister of Interior, retired Lt.-Gen Abdurrahman Dambazau, made this known at the passing-out parade of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) graduates Cadets of 43rd Superintendent Basic course in Kano on Saturday. Dambazau was represented by at the occasion by the ACG of Immigration, Ado Jafar. He said the passing out of the 652 graduates cadets from the Immigration Training School, Kano was a clear demonstration of the Federal Government’s commitment to not only strengthen national security but also to provide gainful employment to the teeming youths of the country. Danbazau said the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) would remain committed to staff training and discipline so as to ensure effective service delivery. He said the ministry and indeed the civil defence, fire, Immigration and prisons services board would continue to maintain absolute zero tolerance for misconduct from any personnel under its supervision. He, therefore, urged those graduating to ensure that they are always guided by the trainings they received as well as by the agency’s rules of engagement in their conduct. In his remark, the Comptroller-General of the NISS, Muhammad Babandede, tasked the graduating cadets on discipline and professional lifestyle. Babandede said the 43rd Superintendent Basic course was the first set of cadets with first degrees.
