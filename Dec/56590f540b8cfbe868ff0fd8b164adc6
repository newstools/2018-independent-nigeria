Abuja – The police may have broken the lid to the gruesome assassination of the immediate past Chief of Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh (rtd.). It would be recalled that Badeh was in his Toyota Tundra truck with registration number, MUB 396 AA, when he was shot by unknown gunmen at a location in Gitata community on Keffi-Bade road, Nasarawa State. Some Gitata residents said the deceased was coming from his farm between Koso and Kugwaru communities when he was shot on December 18, 2018. A credible source at the Force Headquarters in Abuja confirmed the arrest of his suspected killers last night. He said the breakthrough was the product of painstaking, discreet work by operatives, he said are still on the trail of others at large. While initial information suggested that suspects may be paraded today  (Thursday) at Louis Edet House, in Abuja, Daily Independent was later told that the police hierarchy is not taking kindly to the leakage of the arrest of the suspects. According to our source, “The fear is that the leaking of news of the arrests may hamper effort to round up other suspects that are suspected to be on the run”, the source said.
