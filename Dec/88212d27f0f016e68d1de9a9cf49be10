The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA) has expressed its concern at the indecisive disposition of the Federal Government towards concluding the process leading to the implementation of a new National Minimum Wage. Speaking in Lagos, Timothy Olawale, the Director-General of NECA, stated that globally, there was a recognised and acceptable process of setting a National Minimum Wage as enshrined in the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention 131. Olawale declared that the process had been adopted in previous National Minimum Wage setting in Nigeria and was meticulously applied by the National Minimum Wage Committee inaugurated by the President in December, 2017. He emphasised that the labour expected that following the submission of the National Minimum Wage Committee’s Report to the President in November, expedited action would be taken in transmitting a bill to the national assembly as promised by President Muhammadu Buhari. He added: “The President had promised to transmit an Executive bill to the National Assembly for its passage within the shortest possible time. It is, therefore worrisome that seven weeks after the submission of the committee’s report, government is planning to subject the report to another technical Committee, unknown to the process of setting minimum wage. “This delay in the completion of the process had led to the proposed strike by Labour, which is totally undesirable and should be avoided.” Concerned about the negative implication of the proposed strike in January 2019, he expressed regret that a nation whose economy was still reeling under the effects of recent recession, its government would further drag the economy into avoidable abyss.
