Lagos – Performance of the local bourse was slightly bearish last week as sell-offs in market bellwethers marginally surpassed the bargain hunting activities. Although, the benchmark index posted gains on three of the five trading sessions in the week, the All Share Index (ASI) declined 0.2 per cent week-on-week (W-o-W) to settle at 30,866.82 points. In addition, year-to-date (YTD) return moderated to -19.3 per cent and market capitalisation decreased by N2.7 billion W-o-W to N11.3 trillion. Trading activity weakened as average volume and value traded decreased by 7.6 per cent and 21.6 per cent W-o-W to 221.4 million units and N2.2 billion, respectively.

The local bourse started the week on a bearish note as investors took profit in large cap stocks –Stanbic IBTC, Dangote Cement and Nigerian Breweries – which dragged the ASI 0.2 per cent lower.
