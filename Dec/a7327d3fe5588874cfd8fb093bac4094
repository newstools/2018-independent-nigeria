LAGOS – The Ibogun community in the Ibogun-Coker LCDA of Ogun State last Sunday rolled out the drums in celebration of the 19th edition of the annual Ifa Olokun Foundation festival and the first year coronation anniversary of their traditional ruler, the Olu of Ibogun, Owu kingdom, Oba (Dr.) Fakayode Adesina Faluade. Many activities were lined up to add colour to the 10-day long activities as Ibogun sons and daughters, home and abroad members of diplomatic corps, senior government functionaries, members of the organised private sector, friends and well-wishers turned out in their thousands to celebrate Oba Faluade, whom most of them commended for his leadership qualities that had earned the community the accolade of being progressive and very peaceful since his ascension on the exalted throne of his forebears. Rendition of songs by Christian and Islamic groups, cultural dances, inter-faith service, paying of traditional homage by trade groups and association, offer of 2-day free eye screening and treatment exercise for the people, offer of royal blessings for the growth and development of the town, worship of the deities, conferment of chieftaincy titles on deserving individuals, foundation laying ceremony of Ibogun community school, commissioning of school toilets, markets stalls, street lights and transformer and entertainment of guest were some of the highlights of the celebration. Speaking at the occasion, the Baba Oba of Ibogun, Chief Ambaliu Yusuf, explained that the community was proud to have Oba Faluade as their monarch, more so that many achievements had been recorded in the town within the last 365 days of his ascension on the throne. He noted that apart from state-of-the-art palace, which was put in place by the monarch, the issue of epileptic power supply would soon be a thing of the past as a result of the street lights and a big transformer that were commissioned by the monarch as part of activities to mark his first year coronation anniversary. “With modern stalls in our major markets, good toilets in our community school and also the commencement of the construction of another secondary school building project to complement the only one in the community, our Oba’s reign has, no doubt, brought succour, hope and relief to the community, hence our desire to roll out the drums to celebrate his contributions to the socio-economic development of Ibogun and Ogun State in particular and Nigeria in general,’’he added.
