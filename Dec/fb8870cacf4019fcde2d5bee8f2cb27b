LAGOS – Blessing Okagbare, Nigeria’s top female athlete, has expressed misgivings over the poor turnout of spectators to watch events at the just ended National Sports Festival (NSF). Although the USA-based sprinter admitted that it was not solely down to the organisers to lure fans into the venues, she recalled how massive crowd followership was during past editions of the festival. She went on to insinuate that the inability of athletes to record mouth-gaping results at Abuja 2018 could be done to the lack of cheers and chants spurring them on from the stands. While disclosing that she could not compete in the open event because she had her programme fixed on the 2019 circuit, Okagbare said she saw some positives from Abuja 2018, and prayed that they would be sustained. “To the best of my knowledge, the athletes have done very well and I want to commend all the medalists especially in the track events. “l also want to observe that if the stands had been a bit full, it will add more and perhaps motivate the athletes to do better and will translate to good public relation stuff to our sport. “I recalled at 2004 festival here in Abuja and at Ogun 2006 the ambience at the stadium was astonishing and great motivating factor that brought some of us to national limelight we are today. “I am not indicting the organisers considering that the programme had suffered endless postponements and it’s a good we are enjoying it now. “It will be a good thing if all the potentials discovered here are nurtured to greater height instead of leaving them to their respective State government to lie idle and lose the steams in them.”
