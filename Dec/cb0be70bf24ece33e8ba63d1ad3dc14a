Lagos – Godwin Dudu-Orumen, the Edo State Sports Commission (ESSC) chairman, has condemned the atrocious officiating at the 19th edition of the National Sports Festival (NSF) that ends today in Abuja. An incensed Dudu-Orumen, who on Friday at the Indoor Sports Hall of the National Stadium, venue of the gymnastics event, watched as technical officials-referees and judges took what were clearly questionable decisions in the female category of the event, described the performance of the officials as unimpressive. “Referees, umpires and judges have not been impressive at this NSF. Their conduct has left a lot of questions unanswered and has certainly affected the quality of the festival. Now, I understand why fresh talents and other best sportsmen and women do not get to represent the country,” he said. He also said that the shenanigans of these officials put Nigeria at a disadvantage internationally. “I now know why our arbitrating officials hardly make it to the international platforms,” he said. He noted that the quality of officiating had cast a shadow over some of the victories recorded at the NSF. Even coaches were not spared by the newly appointed ESSC boss who accused them of colluding with the technical officials in perpetrating fraud. “Victories are contrived and settled by other considerations that do not meet the eyes. Coaches too are involved in underhand tactics that affect results especially in the combat sports,” he said. He said that the negative effect of this deplorable situation on Nigerian sports is incalculable, given that it was even struggling presently to make an impact on the global scene. “There’s enough stacked against our sports already. Very questionable officiating compounds it in a riveting manner and that’s worrisome. “Something has to be done and done quickly otherwise these groups of people will kill our sports. The activity faces enough odds and challenges from several fronts already folks,” he said.
