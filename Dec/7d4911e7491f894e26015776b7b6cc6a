Decades after polio was eradicated from Papua New Guinea, the crippling and sometimes deadly disease has returned, leaving doctors scrambling to revive long-lapsed vaccination programmes. Until earlier this year, the polio virus was endemic in only three countries in the world: Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. But a relatively rare strain is now spreading throughout rugged, jungle-cloaked Papua New Guinea, one of the world’s poorest countries. Since the first case was detected in April — paralysing a six-year-old boy named Gafo near the northern coast — polio has infected dozens more nationwide, prompting the government to declare a national emergency.
