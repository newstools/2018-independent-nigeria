Lobi Stars of Makurdi face a huge battle in the second leg of the CAF Champions League when they face Kenyan giants, Gor Mahia, after the Kenyans defeated them 3-1 in Nairobi on Sunday. The result means that the Ortom Boys must win with 2-0 to progress to the mini-league stage. Samuel Onyango scored a brace to put Gor Mahia in a pole position. Meanwhile, a draw in the return leg in Nigeria will be enough to push the Kenyan champions to the money bracket. Onyango scored two quick goals late in the first half to add to Jacques Tuyisenge’s early opener and help K’Ogalo keep their unbeaten run in the competition.
