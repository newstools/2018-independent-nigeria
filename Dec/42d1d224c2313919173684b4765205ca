Italy’s health minister has removed 30 doctors and scientists from the ministry’s public health advisory committee as part of the “government of change” promised by the 5-Star Movement and League, according to Washingtonpost.com reports. Giulia Grillo is from the 5-Star Movement, which opposes the previous Democratic Party-led government’s move to increase the number of mandatory vaccinations to 10. Grillo has said she’s in favor of vaccinations but wants a more flexible approach. The scientists that were sacked say they were removed without legitimate reason or warning. Grillo said she wanted to open the board to other worthy members. The 30 appointed board members serve alongside an equal number of experts who participate due to their institutional offices, such as the heads of Italy’s pharmacological agency and transplant network.
