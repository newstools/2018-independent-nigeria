Lagos – Nigeria have been handed tricky ties at the group stage of the 2019 Women World Cup after the country was pooled in Group A alongside hosts, France, Norway and Korea Republic. While Nigeria avoided superpowers such as China, Germany and England, observers posit that playing against the host nation comes with a huge challenge. Nigeria will open account against former champions, Norway, who braced all odds to win the title in 1995 after finishing runners up in the maiden edition in 1991. Afterwards, they will play Korea Republic before ending the group stage against the hosts. Norway, it will be recalled, are also former Olympic champions. Meanwhile, South Africa must dig deep to come out of Group B, where they will engage Germany, China and Spain. The Bayana Bayana, who are making their debut at the global stage, were earlier housed in Pot 4 alongside Nigeria, Cameroon and Chile before the main draw. The last African representatives, Cameroon, will be engaging Canada, New Zealand and Holland in Group E. In the other groups, England will play Scotland, Argentina and Japan in Group D, while Group C has Australia, Italy, Brazil and Jamaica, even as the quartet of USA, Thailand, Chile and Sweden will be playing in Group F. Cameroon will start their affairs with a match against Canada as South Africa will start by confronting Spain. The World Cup gets underway on June 7, 2019 with a mouthwatering tie between France and Korea Republic.
