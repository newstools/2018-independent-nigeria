LAGOS – Kweku Tandoh, the chairman of Lagos State Sports Commission (LSSC), has hailed the new champion in the Men’s Singles of 2018 Asoju Oba Table Tennis Cup Championship, saying that his victory has further proved that the state remained on course in its developmental programmes. The 50th edition of the Asoju Oba Molade Okoya-Thomas Table Tennis Cup Championship ended at the multi-purpose Hall of the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere at the weekend with David Fayele, who can be regarded as a ‘rookie’, took the shine off Europe-based Olajide Omotayo in the final that ended 4-2. To the applause of the dignitaries present at the final ceremony, Fayele of the Nigerian Army was presented with the star prize of the competition, a brand new car, courtesy of the family of the late Sir Molade Okoya-Thomas, the sponsor of the oldest running competition in Nigeria. To the chairman of the LSSC, Tandoh, Fayele, defeating an experienced Omotayo, was a testimony that Lagos State had been a breeding ground for upcoming talents, who would take over from the ageing athletes very soon. He said Fayele would be one of the several youngsters Team Lagos would parade at the 19th National Sports Festival (NSF), which holds in Abuja from December 6 to 16, adding that the LSSC would leave nothing to chance to ensure Team Lagos have good outing in Abuja. Reacting to his victory, Fayele said that he was able to overcome the challenge of his opponent with determination and focus. “When I discovered that I would be playing Omotayo, who is based abroad, I have to double up my training and as a soldier, I have this strong belief that a civilian cannot defeat a soldier in any contest.
