The duo of Michael Afolabi and Shafiu Suleiman have been arrested by The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, before Justice Idris Kogo of Federal High Court, Sokoto on a two-count charge bordering on obtaining money by false pretence, forgery and criminal breach of trust. One of the charges reads: ”That you Michael Afolabi and Shafiu Suleiman sometimes in July, 2016 within Sokoto Judicial Division of the High Court, with intent to defraud, conspired to obtain the sum of N12, 000,000 (Twelve Million Naira) by false pretence from N.G.M. Nig. Ltd thereby committed an offence contrary to section 8(a) of the Advance fee fraud and other Fraud Related offences Act 2006 and punishable under section 1(3) of the same act”. They pleaded “not guilty” to the charges. Upon taking their plea, prosecuting counsel, Tofik Lasis, asked the court for a date for hearing. The defence counsel, M. Adeleke, made an oral application for bail but it was not entertained. Justice Kogo, thereafter, adjourned to November 30, 2018 for hearing of formal bail application.
