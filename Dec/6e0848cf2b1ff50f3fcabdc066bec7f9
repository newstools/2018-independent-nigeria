The First Minister has defended her record against accusations of damaging cuts affecting schoolchildren with additional support needs. Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard told the story of how the family of a 13-year-old with autism say his education has been disrupted by a lack of teachers qualified to support him. At First Minister’s Questions, Mr Leonard said: “Callum’s family believe that the teacher in charge of this (additional needs) class did not have the appropriate training for it and so did not make the right decisions for Callum, for his schedule, for his work or for his environment. “His mother told me that: “This resulted in Callum going into meltdown on a daily basis. “The teacher would shout and things would escalate further. Callum would be manhandled to a soft room”.” Mr Leonard said there were 122 fewer specialist teachers under Nicola Sturgeon’s Government but the number of pupils identified as having additional support needs has gone up by over 40,000.
