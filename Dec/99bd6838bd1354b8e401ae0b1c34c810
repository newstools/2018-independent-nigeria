(Zaman Al Wasl TV)- For ten years, the 16-year-old Moustafa and his sister Aseel have been suffering from Thalassemia. They are in dire need of blood transfusion every month amid severe health and living conditions. Their father died under torture by the Syrian security three years ago. Mustafaâ€™s mother became the sole breadwinner. She works in the morning to secure the living necessities and to buy medicines for her two children. Mustafa and Aseel seek an admission to the Turkish hospitals where they could get the proper treatment.
