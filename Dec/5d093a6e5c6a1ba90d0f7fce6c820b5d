Ariana Grande celebrated her Billboard Woman of the Year award by getting a new tattoo with her grandmother. The 25-year-old singer was honoured with the Woman of the Year prize at New York’s Pier 36 on Thursday (06Dec18) after a successful but difficult year. While she achieved her first U.S. number one single with Thank U, Next, Ariana has weathered a split from fiance Pete Davidson in October, which came a month after the death of her former long-term boyfriend Mac Miller. On Friday Ariana took to her Instagram Stories to document herself and her Nonna, Marjorie Grande, 93, getting her first tattoo. “I feel fine,” Marjorie said as she laughed at the pain with her family members, including Ariana’s mother Joan Grande and brother Frankie Grande. “I’ve had a little bit more excitement than this.” For her tattoo, Marjorie chose to have her late husband Frank Grande’s nickname “Ciccio”, which is an Italian translation of Frank, inked on her left ring finger. While Ariana got a moon inked on her hand. The Dangerous Woman hitmaker gave a heartfelt speech at the Billboard event, which also honoured among others SZA, country singer Kacey Musgraves, Cyndi Lauper and Janelle Monae, admitting that the award had come during “one of the best years in my career and one of like the worst years in my life”. “I’m just saying that because I feel like a lot of people would look at someone in my position right now I guess; Woman of the Year, an artist that could be at her peak, reaching her you know, whatever, and think, you know, ‘She’s really got her s**t together; she’s really on it; she has got it all’,” she said. “I do, but as far as my personal life goes I really have no idea what the f**k I am doing… So yeah, it’s been a very conflicting one.” The singer has set a new streaming record with Thank U, Next racking up an incredible 14.9 million streams beating the 14.2 million hits Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You managed last year.
