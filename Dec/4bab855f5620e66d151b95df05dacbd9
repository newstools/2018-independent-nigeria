Amid the constant economic aggression and the hike in the price of basic products, Venezuela is seeking on Friday to curb the monetary speculation and inflation with new measures announced by President Nicolas Maduro.  Among the main items stands out the increase of minimum wage and pensions in 2.5 units with respect to the increase last August. The minimum wage, fixed at the average unit value of the cryptocurrency Petro as part of the initiative launched since August, is placed as of December 1 at 4,500 sovereign bolivars, equivalent to 46 Euros. Maduro explained that as a correction factor, the equivalent of the digital asset will increase 9,000 sovereign bolivars as of Thursday, so the wage maintains its equivalence with half of a unit of Petro. Another of the measures was the negotiation of new prices agreed with businessmen and producers with the Executive. For New Yearâ€™s celebrations, the State is also distributing 20,000 tons of meat, 750 tons of Christmas food, 15 million toys, 35 million pieces of clothing and footwear throughout the country through the Local Committees for Supply and Production.
