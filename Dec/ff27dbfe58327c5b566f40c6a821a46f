 Over the couple of years, Eagles Head Coach Gernot Rohr has scouted Europe for players of Nigerian origin, as he builds a team for the future, according to Footballlive.ng reports. The process has since seen the introduction of Bryan Idowu, Tyronne Ebuehi and Ola Aina, all of whom have now earned international caps with Nigeria, but Victor Agali has advised the Coaches to pump the breaks. The former Eagles player who is also the teamâ€™s chief scout has told Brila.net that only a few players are currently required to shore up areas of need on the team, and there will be no need for an influx of players. Nigeria will return to the continental competition next year after missing out on two consecutive editions.
