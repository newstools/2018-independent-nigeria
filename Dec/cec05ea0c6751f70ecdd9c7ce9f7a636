Abakaliki – Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State has sacked 48 members of the state Neighborhood Security Watch and also suspended 27 others for acts of negligence, absenteeism and abuse of mandate. The Neighbourhood Security Watch is the state internal security outfit recently set up by the government to help fight crime in the state. Saturday INDEPENDENT reports that there have been calls in some quarters urging the government to disband the group following security reports that some members of the group were engaging in armed robbery, stealing, thefts and sundry security breaches in the state. Announcing the sack and suspension on Friday, the Senior Special Assistant (SSA)to Governor Umahi on Internal Security, Dr. Kenneth Ugbala said that the action followed flagrant disregard to their duties and non-commitment to the job description. Ugbala said that in all 48 personnel were sacked with immediate effect while 27 others were suspended indefinitely. He urged members of the public to henceforth desist from conducting any government transaction with the individuals adding that anybody doing business with affected persons were doing so at their own detriments. Ugbala therefore directed all the sacked personnel to immediately return all the Neighbourhood Security Watch items including ID Cards, Motorcycles and Uniforms, to his office before the close of work today (Friday, 28th December, 2018). He also directed those on suspension to proceed to the Disciplinary Committee from today (Friday, 28th December, 2018), by 10am at Multi-purpose Hall, Cabinet Office, Abakaliki for further directive.
