Saudi Arabia, on Friday, welcomed a deal reached between the Yemeni government and the Shiite group at talks that ended in Sweden the previous day. On Thursday, UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, said Yemen’s warring sides had reached an agreement on the embattled province of Hodeida, including a ceasefire there and a mutual redeployment of forces from its crucial port. In June, the Saudi-led coalition began a major offensive to seize Hodeida, which has been under the control of the Houthi rebels since late 2014. “The handover of the Hodeida port is considered an important step to help end humanitarian suffering of the brotherly Yemeni people,’’ an unnamed official at the Saudi Foreign Ministry said on Friday, according to the Kingdom’s state news agency, SPA. Hodeida, in western Yemen, is strategically important because of its port, which is the entry point for some 80 per cent of Yemen’s imports and aid. “The Kingdom is committed to reaching a political solution in Yemen that guarantees its security, stability and territorial integrity,’’ the official added. This month, delegations from the Yemeni Government and the rebels held week-long talks in the Swedish town of Rimbo, in an attempt to end the country’s four-year war that pushed the country to the brink of famine. The UN Security Council was due later Friday to discuss Yemen, with focus on the outcome of the Sweden talks. Yemen has been embroiled in a power struggle between the government and the rebels since late 2014.
