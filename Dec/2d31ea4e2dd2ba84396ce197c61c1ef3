After setting a record in 2016 by becoming the first studio to reach the $7 billion mark at the worldwide box office in a single year, Walt Disney Pictures has now matched that feat in 2018. The Mouse House is responsible for four of the year’s top eight releases in Avengers: Infinity War ($2.048 billion), Black Panther ($1.347 billion),Incredibles 2 (1.241 billion) and Ant-Man and the Wasp ($622.7), while other big releases include Solo: A Star Wars Story ($392.9 million), Ralph Breaks the Internet ($261.2 million and counting) and Christopher Robin ($197.4 million). 2019 is also shaping up to be another huge – and potentially record-breaking – year for Disney, with its big releases including Captain Marvel, Dumbo, Avengers: Endgame, Aladdin, Toy Story 4, The Lion King, Artemis Fowl, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX.
