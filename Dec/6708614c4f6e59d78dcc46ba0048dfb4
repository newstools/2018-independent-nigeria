Georgia’s voters have one more chance to make their voices heard about the state’s election infrastructure. Tuesday’s runoff election for Georgia secretary of state pits Republican state Rep. Brad Raffensperger against former Democratic congressman John Barrow. Neither candidate won more than 50 percent of votes on Nov. 6. Raffensperger has support from President Donald Trump, while Barrow is endorsed by former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. At stake in their runoff is the ability to reshape the state’s election system, which came under a national microscope during the recent race for governor between Abrams and Republican Secretary of State – now governor-elect – Brian Kemp. Raffensperger has defended how Georgia canceled the registrations of hundreds of thousands of voters; he says he’ll focus on election integrity and making sure only legal citizens can cast ballots. Barrow says changes are needed. He told The Associated Press in an interview that Georgia does a “pretty good job of keeping people from cheating,” but a “lousy job of making it easier for folks to vote.”
