With Bad Boys for Life bubbling along nicely in pre-production, it’s been confirmed that actor Joe Pantoliano will reprise his role as Captain Howard. The character appeared in both the original Bad Boys movie from 1995 and its sequel, Bad Boys 2, released eight years later. Pantoliano is a recognisable face from the likes of The Matrix – where he played the devious Cypher – plus classic TV show The Sopranos and director Christopher Nolan’s Memento. The news of Pantoliano’s involvement was announced by Deadline, with the cameras also set to commence shooting next month for a slated theatrical release in January 2020. Meanwhile, returning star Will Smith has previously revealed that he was “broke” before landing his breakout role in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. After one of his albums flopped (produced alongside DJ Jazzy Jeff), things appeared to take a dramatic downturn, especially when the day came to pay his taxes. “I had spent all my money, and I didn’t forget, but I didn’t pay the IRS,” the Aladdin actor explained. “In my mind, I wasn’t trying to avoid paying taxes. I was just like, ‘Ah damn, they need their money’.” The IRS ended up taking Smith’s belongings and he subsequently went “broke”. He added that “being famous and broke is a shitty combination”.
