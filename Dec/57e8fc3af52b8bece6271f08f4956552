Lobi Stars of Makurdi playmaker, Oahimije Kelly Kester, is relying on history to help his team beat Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa in the CAF Champions League, as he remembers doing same in his days with Enyimba of Aba. Following Friday’s group stage draw that pits ‘The Brazilians’ against the Nigerian champions, Kester is upbeat that Lobi could repeat what The Peoples’ Elephant did against the South African club. Although Sundowns are rated higher than Lobi Stars in terms of pedigree, having won the continental showpiece just three years ago, Kester insists that the fact Enyimba were able to beat them would inspire another Nigerian victory. Kester also fancies his side’s chances against two other former champions in the same group, as Lobi will also battle Wydad Casablanca of Morocco and ASEC Mimosas of Cote d’Ivoire, but they start with a home clash against Sundowns. He recounted: “It was a great experience for me because that was my first time playing in the CAF Champions League. “I still remember that screamer Dare ojo scored and over both legs, the game against Sundowns was really enjoyable. “It was an amazing experience playing against a team that is well structured and has the right philosophy about how football should be played. “They are a very physical side and at the same time loves playing the game on the ground. “Having two recent former champions makes it look tough, but we are Lobi Stars and that Naija spirit of never-say-die always gets us through. “I remember our game against Gor Mahia, a lot of people wrote us off but in the end we qualified.”
