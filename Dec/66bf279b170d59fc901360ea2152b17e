LAGOS – The National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) has ordered the immediate withdrawal and cancellation of operational guidelines on State Insurance Producers (SIP) barely 24 hours after a fruitful town hall meeting of top management of the company and members of Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB). In a swift reaction, Mr. Shola Tinubu, the President of the Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB), appreciated Alhaji Mohammed Kari, the Commissioner for Insurance, and his team for consideration of NCRIB plea. He also described the Commission as a listening regulatory body who has again demonstrated the desire to grow an industry that would contribute meaningfully to the nation’s economic growth. Tinubu, in a statement, made available to Journalists, noted that the gesture would further enhance the council’s confidence in the leadership of NAICOM, stressing that the confidence reposed on NAICOM was never betrayed.
