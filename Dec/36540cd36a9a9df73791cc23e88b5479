LAGOS – Mr. Allen Onyema, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Air Peace has described the outgoing 2018 as very challenging to the aviation industry, especially the airline sub-sector. Onyema, however, said that despite the challenge in the sector within the year, the airline was able to mitigate against them and still remained the first carrier in the annals of carriers in Nigeria to acquire the Boeing 777 aircraft. Speaking with journalists yesterday in Lagos, Onyema decried that the sordid global economic situation in the world severely impacted negatively on operating airlines, but noted that of the flying public on the operations of the airline had made it a preferred choice for travellers. Onyema also assured that the airline would eventually commence its international routes and consolidate on regional operations in 2019. According to him, plans for long-haul flights to Dubai, Sharjah, London, Guangzhou-China, Houston, Mumbai and Johannesburg would be unveiled within the New Year.
