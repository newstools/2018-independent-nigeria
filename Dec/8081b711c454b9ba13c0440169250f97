Yenagoa – Gboribiogha Jonah, the Bayelsa State Deputy Governor, has said the Nigerian military has contributed towards the country’s unity more than any other institution.

According to him, the loyalty of members of the armed forces to fatherland had been total and undeniable. The deputy governor, therefore, called for the provision of adequate equipment for the military personnel to enable them effectively carry out their statutory responsibility of protecting the territorial integrity of the country. Jonah commended the 16 Brigade, Nigerian Army, Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, for working for the peace in the state, stressing that the state government would continue to partner with the army to sustain the existing peace in the state.
