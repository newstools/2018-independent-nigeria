UYO – Former Akwa Ibom State chapter chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with over 20,000 followers during a rally last Monday, have raised alarm over alleged threats to their lives. The APC chieftains, who spoke through Joseph Amah, their leader, said they and other defectors were attacked by hoodlums allegedly sponsored by the APC on Monday on their way back from the rally. The ex-party chiefs, who addressed a press conference in Uyo said the former chapter chairmen of Nsit Atai, Eket, Ikot Ekpene and other former APC stalwarts were harassed and intimidated for shifting their loyalty to Governor Udom Emmanuel. Amah said: “Our members in their thousands trooped out and colourfully celebrated their freedom from political oppression and unending impunity, as practised in the APC. Thereafter, as our people were heading home joyously to share the good news of redemption with their kith and kin, they were molested on the road by hoodlums sponsored by the APC. “In Nsit Atai, the former chapter chairman’s vehicle was attacked and his vehicle tyres destroyed. In Ibesikpo Asutan, Eket and Ikot Ekpene, the former APC stalwarts were harassed and intimidated. This ugly situation is most reprehensible and must be totally condemned. “We wish to alert the public that if anything bad happens to us, Chief Godswill Akpabio, Obong Nsima Ekere, Uyo Nathaniel and Chief Sunny Ibanga should be held responsible. Having not yielded to their pressures to remain in their evil political coven, they have resorted to threats and violence. “In the days ahead, we will expose the contents of the play book of the APC and how they hope to overrun the state with federal might.”
