Jason Momoa, who is hosting Saturday Night Live this weekend, dropped a hint about what fans can expect from his debut on the show. It’s a bit of a dream come true for the actor who’s a huge fan of the comedy sketch show and it’s obvious the excitement levels are already running high. Speaking to RTÉ Entertainment at the junket for his new superhero epic Aquaman, the former Game of Thrones star offered an exuberant high five over landing the coveted hosting gig. When asked if he was excited, he said: “I am!”, but said he needs to get through the press tour for Aquaman before worrying about his SNL hosting duties. When pressed about what fans can expect, Momoa deadpanned: “I have a feeling we can make fun of a lot of things I’ve done in my career so I think we’re set.” Judging by this highly amusing promo, in which Momoa fully indulges his action movie star status, we’re in for a treat. Jason Momoa hosts Saturday Night Live on Saturday, December 8. There will be previews of his new movie Aquaman from Wednesday, December 12 before it goes on general release on Friday, December 14.
