In its bid to tackle land corruption, the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) yesterday launched proposals on youth combatting land corruption in Africa, saying that its intention was to look into different ideas on how to achieve the task. According to the advocacy Centre’s Executive Director, Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, the launch was an opportunity to look into various ideas on how land corruption could be tackled, adding that such ideas when actualised will further enhance peaceful and inclusive society. Rafsanjani, who disclosed the plan in his speech on Wednesday at the launch of proposals, assured that various ideas that are capable of arresting the situation were being looked into as they would further engender peaceful and all-encompassing societies for sustainable development in all its ramifications. He said: “Today, presents a huge opportunity for us to look into different ideas on how to tackle land corruption in Africa which will further enhance peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development at all levels”. While noting that the ideas which will be developed further would be driven by young people, he asserted that “60% of Sub Saharan Africa population is below 25. Rafsanjani spoke from paradoxical perspective when he said: “You will agree with me that Africa is a wealthy continent with the poorest of people living in it. Nigeria is no exception to this dilemma as her citizens remain extremely poor despite being endowed with numerous natural resources and skilled manpower to effectively and efficiently drive the country into prosperity. This has been as a result of mismanagement and corruption in the allocation of these resources which includes land”. Recalling Transparency International’s Corruption Barometer Worldwide released in 2013, he said one in five people report having paid a bribe for land services; however, in Sub-Saharan Africa, a client of land administration services is affected every second, assuring that “We have a duty to ensure that ownership of land is not restricted to the rich and wealthy alone neither should it be for a particular gender or age group.
