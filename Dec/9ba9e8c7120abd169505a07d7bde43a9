LAGOS – The draws for the 2019 FIFA Women World Cup slated for France will be conducted on Saturday in France with all the 24 countries anticipating whom their opponents would be. The 24 qualified countries will be divided into six groups at the draw and each group will feature one of the top seeded teams, with host country, France, guaranteed their place as the first team in Group A. The identity of the five other teams in Pot 1 will be based on the FIFA/ Coca-Cola Women’s World Ranking to be released on Friday, December. As with every tournament and every draw, each of the groups is bound to throw up mouth-watering clashes and fixtures. Ranked 38th 49th and 50th in the world respectively as at October, 2018 ranking and the prospect of massive lifts in Friday’s ranking quite slim, it is obvious that Nigeria, Cameroon and South Africa, the African representatives, will most certainly find themselves contesting against some of the best women football countries in the world at the group stage. With countries like the United States, Germany, England, France, as well as Canada and other big countries like Sweden and Norway among the top ranked teams, African representatives will have to brace up for a tough challenge in France. Meanwhile, according to investigations, anticipation is growing among not just the participating teams but also from football lovers, who cannot wait to find out who their country has been drawn against, and in which cities they will be able to watch the matches.
