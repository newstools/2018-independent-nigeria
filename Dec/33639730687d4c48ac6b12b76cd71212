Oleh – The Catholic Diocese of Bomadi, Delta State, has celebrated its first anniversary with a call to Nigerian politicians to imbibe the kind of leadership in the Christian fold. The celebration was anchored by Bishop Hyacinth Egbebo. The first anniversary also witnessed the ordination of eight candidates as deacons to serve in the Lord’s vineyard. Egbebo, in his homily, admonished politicians to sacrifice for the betterment of the country. He stressed that, “God has blessed this country with fertile land, crude oil deposits for the inhabitants to live decent lives.” The cleric noted that the salaries, allowances and embezzlement of public fund by politicians were what had made the country to be rated as headquarter of poverty in the world. He also criticized, saying that they were supposed to serve but rather it is the people who are serving them, lamenting that their exorbitant lifestyles have led to the crippling of the nation’s economy. “Instead of politicians to be afraid of the electorates, it is now the electorates that are afraid of the politicians, and they live in affluence while we live in squalor.” The bishop posited that in advanced countries, the leaders rule by the dictates of the people and this, he said, brings sanity to the system. He noted that in the Republican Island of Mauritius, where their soil is not as fertile as Nigeria’s, their Economy is 80 percent better than Nigeria because of the prudent management of resources , its only export , sugar to the outside world. However, Egbebo commended Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State for bringing development closer to people thereby providing employment to the people.
