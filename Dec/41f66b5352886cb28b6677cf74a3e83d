Lagos – The 19th National Sports Festival billed for Abuja the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) will start today and ends on December 16 at the National Stadium Abuja. Over 10, 000 athletes and officials are expected at the several postponed event owing to the failure of Cross River to meet up with the financial requirements. According to the Sports Minister, Solomon Dalung, 37 sports will feature in this festival as against 25 that featured in the last edition which held in Lagos. Dalung, during the unveiling of the official Mascot and Logo of the Festival, said that Cross River State failure to host the event, led to the take-over by the federal government. The Minister said that the objective was to give more Nigerians the opportunity to be part of the fiesta and have a sense of belonging. Going by the 37 sports to be competed for among participating states, the festival will be very intensive as the defending champions – Delta – are sure to meet tough challenge; Delta have been winning the festival since 2004 edition which was also hosted by Abuja. This underscores the interests and investment in the festival by the organisers; the request for the huge funds, no doubt is imperative and deliberate attempt to revitalise the festival which seemed to have lost its glamour for more attention and attraction from stakeholders.
