A gay pharmacist who mercilessly strangled his wife so he could start a new life in Australia with his boyfriend and a £2 million life insurance payout will serve at least 30 years of a life sentence behind bars. Greedy Mitesh Patel, 37, had plotted to kill his wife Jessica for years and throttled her with his hands after choking her with a bag and subduing her with insulin. She fought for her life during the attack at the marital home in Middlesbrough before her husband staged a robbery, ransacking the property to make it look like an intruder had killed her. Mr Justice Goss sentenced Patel to life and passed a minimum term of 30 years, saying: “You have no remorse for your actions. “Any pity you have is for yourself.” Patel made a series of fundamental errors in his plan to kill his wife, including a botched attempt to hide his house’s CCTV hard drive and leaving the duct tape he used to bind her body at their pharmacy. The judge told Patel: “As the police investigation progressed, the full extent of your attitude and behaviour towards Jessica over the nine years of your marriage was revealed. “She clearly loved you and was a dutiful wife. “She wanted nothing more than to have children and live a normal family life. “The difficulty is that you had no sexual attraction to her; you were attracted to men.” Mrs Patel was to some extent aware of her husband’s sexuality, the judge said.
