Liverpool forward Sadio Mane faces a late fitness test to be in contention for Wednesday’s English Premier League trip to Burnley after sustaining a foot injury, manager Jurgen Klopp has said. Senegal international Mane suffered a cut which required several stitches during Sunday’s 1-0 victory over Everton in the Merseyside derby, but Klopp refused on Tuesday to rule out the 26-year-old. “Sadio really had an awful cut on his foot. It needed to be stitched. He is okay but walking around here now in flip-flops — and you don’t play in flip-flops,” Klopp told reporters. “That means in this moment he is not ready, but we will see later.” Liverpool could also be without defender Andy Robertson who suffered a dead leg. “With Robbo it is not that serious as with Sadio, but we need to have a look.” Klopp also said he had accepted a Football Association charge of misconduct for his wild celebration after Divock Origi scored in the sixth minute of added time at Anfield against Everton. He had been given until Thursday to respond, but the German said he would pay the fine. “I couldn’t avoid it obviously…  If there was no rule, we as managers would do it every week. “That’s what rules are for and, if you break rules, you have to be fined for it,” Klopp added. “I don’t think anyone thought it was massively wrong. It happened, a fine, I’ll pay it, no problem.” Klopp was asked about the form of forward Roberto Firmino, who has gone off the boil this season, scoring just three goals in 14 league appearances. “It’s completely normal. It’s not that he’s playing his best football in every second. You have moments when you fly and moments when you have to work and come again,” Klopp said. “Nothing to worry about. It’s a normal football season… We all have to go through this and everything will be fine.” Liverpool are second in the league with 36 points from 14 games, while Burnley are second from bottom with nine points.
