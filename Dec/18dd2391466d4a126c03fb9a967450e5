LAGOS – Dana Air at the weekend concluded re-certification by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), days after the commencement of the exercise with the agency. This is as the airline promised that by 2019, it would acquire more aircraft to beef up its present fleet, saying this would also enable it increase its flights and cities covered within the country. The airline had suspended flight operations for few days following the recertification exercise. The airline, in a statement by Mr. Kingsley Ezenwa, its spokesman, said the conclusion of the exercise would enable it to ease the pain of travellers who had had to bear the high cost of tickets as a result of flight shortage across the country. Ezenwa said that re-certification in Nigeria’s aviation industry was a standard practice conducted every two years by the NCAA and during the period, an airline’s operation was totally reviewed from ground handling to quality assurance and particularly safety standards. He expressed happiness that the airline was able to scale the rigorous process. He also lauded NCAA for carrying out a thorough check on its operations before re-certifying the airline, but decried negative reports in the media within the period, saying that they were unnecessary.
