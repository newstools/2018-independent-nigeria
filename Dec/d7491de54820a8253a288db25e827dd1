A bipartisan vote in the US Senate on Thursday represented a rare rebuke of Trump administration policies from some of his Republican allies. The Chamber voted 56-41 to end US military aid to Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, following the condemnation by several prominent Senate Republicans of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s involvement in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. President Trump and top officials in his administration have stood by Mohammed, suggesting against the assessment of the CIA that the young leader may not have directed the killing. Lawmakers in Trump’s own party, including Senators Lindsay Graham and Bob Corker, said after a briefing with the CIA director that there is “zero” chance Mohammed did not direct the murder. The legislation now must wait on a vote from the House of Representatives, which will not happen until Democrats take control of the lower chamber next month.
