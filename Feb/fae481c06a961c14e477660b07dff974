The Ugandan police on Tuesday began investigations into the death of two Europeans in the capital Kampala on Feb. 19, police spokesperson Emillian Kayima said Tuesday. Kayima said a 54-year-old Belgian male was suspected of committing suicide at his rented apartment in a posh suburb community on Feb. 19, and a 64-year-old German male died at a hospital on Friday, two days after reportedly developing a strange illness. “We have embarked on investigations to establish what exactly killed those two people,” said Kayima. The Belgian and German males were among the six Westerners found dead in Uganda over the past 20 days, with the first case which involved a Swedish national reported on Feb. 5. Ugandan investigators have blamed the earlier deaths on narcotics or heart attacks. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
