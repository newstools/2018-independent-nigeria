An EU delegation in Myanmar on Monday urged authorities to protect civilians from human rights violations in the country’s Kachin State where the military has been clashing with ethnic armed groups. “Decades of conflict in Kachin state have displaced families, disrupted development, caused despair and left communities divided,” Monday’s joint statement, issued after a diplomatic trip by EU heads of mission to the state, said. The statement called for an end to hostilities, protection of civilians, and for access to humanitarian aid to be resumed. Aerial bombardments in Kachin have killed and injured a number of civilians as well as displaced more than 3,000 in the last two months, according to a statement by London-based Burma Human Rights Network. On Feb. 13, two of Myanmar’s ethnic armed groups signed a nationwide ceasefire agreement, providing a jump-start to de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s faltering peace process. She has been criticised for failing to end Myanmar’s 70-year civil wars, which she made a priority when she swept to power following landslide elections in 2015 “The visit confirms our fear that Myanmar’s transition to democracy has not yet brought durable peace and progress to Kachin state,” the EU said on Monday. NAN reports that the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said humanitarian access to conflict areas in Myanmar is currently worse than at any point in the past few years. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
