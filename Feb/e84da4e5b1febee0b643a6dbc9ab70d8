The Kwara State House of Assembly on Tuesday passed an amendment bill halting payment of pension to former governors, deputy governors and other officers holding political offices after their tenure in office. The passage of the bill followed the consideration of the report of the House Committee on Establishment and Public Service at the Committee of the Whole House sitting in Ilorin. The motion for the passage of the bill was moved by the Deputy House Leader, Segilola Abdulkadir and was unanimously adopted by members. The Deputy Speaker, Matthew Okedare, who presided over the plenary, directed the Clerk of the House, Mohammed Katsina, to prepare clean copy of the bill for governorâ€™s assent. The bill, which was forwarded to the House by Governor AbdulFatah Ahmed, sought to review the existing law where payment of pension for former governors and deputy governors after their tenures would be suspended. 2 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
