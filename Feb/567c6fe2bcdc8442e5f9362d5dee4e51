Lagos – Six World Indoor Championships medals will be reallocated during ceremonies at the IAAF World Indoor Championships Birmingham 2018 on Friday and Saturday 2-3 March. These upgrades follow the disqualification of the results of the original medallists after their sanction for anti-doping rule violations. Among those receiving their reallocated medals is Tianna Bartoletta of the USA, who was promoted to gold in the long jump for the 2006 World Indoor Championships in Moscow. Her ceremony, which will include a flag raising and national anthem, will take place in Arena Birmingham at the start of the evening session on Saturday 3 March. In total, six athletes from across five events at three previous editions of the IAAF World Indoor Championships have accepted invitations to receive their reallocated medals in Birmingham. “After the very positive feedback at the beginning of the new reallocation process last August in London, we are delighted to continue to honour the athletes for their achievements,” said IAAF President Sebastian Coe. “And what better way than in front of full arena of passionate athletics fans at a major championships.” On Friday Danish Joachim Olsen,  who won shot put bronze in 2006 will receive his silver medal, while German Ralf Bartels, who was also promoted to silver having won bronze at the 2010 championships in Doha will receive his medal on Saturday. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
