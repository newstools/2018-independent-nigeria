Lagos â€“ The local bourse recorded losses at the close of trading yesterday as the All Share Index (ASI) fell 0.66 per cent to 42,299.56 points, while year-to-date return contracted to 10.6 per cent.

Accordingly, investors lost N100.5 billion in value as market capitalisation declined to N15.2 trillion.

Performance across sectors was mixed as three of five indices closed in the red. The banking index depreciated the most, down 1.3 per cent due to losses in Zenith Bank (-2.5%), Guaranty Trust Bank (-0.8%) and Union Bank Nigeria (-5.0%).
