Abeokuta – Bukola Saraki, president of the Senate, has called on Nigerians to embrace renewable energy to reduce the effect of climate change and prevent environmental degradation in the country. Saraki, who made the call at the grand opening of Asteven Energy Academy, located at Asese area, along Lagos-Ibadan Expressway in Ibafo, Ogun State, revealed that since the passage of the Climate Change Bill by the National Assembly, the government made it imperative that issues concerning climate change were taken seriously. According to him, renewable energy would protect the environment against degradation and increase power access as well as create jobs for the teeming youths. He commended the Ogun State government for its industrialisation drive and creating conducive environment for businesses to thrive. According to Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun, with the commissioning of the largest indigenous renewable energy company, the state has recorded another giant stride in its industrialisation drive. Amosun, represented by Yetunde Onanuga, his deputy, said government would not relent in its effort at creating a conducive and business-friendly environment for the people in the state. He said the government was determined to encourage more private investors to do business in the state, as this would in turn, create wealth for its citizenry. Sunday Akpoyibo, managing director of the company, said the company was not only meant for renewable energy creation, but also a training institute which has come to add value and better the lives of the citizens. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
