The Ataoja of Osogboland, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun, has called for more sponsors to sustain the dwindling fortunes of the Osun-Osogbo festival. Olanipekun, who made the call at a press conference in Lagos on Friday, said the festival was being sustained with the support rendered by some prominent sponsors. “We need more sponsors to ensure sustainability of the festival because without corporate sponsors, the festival will not be successful,” he said. This year’s edition of the festival will hold on August 18. The monarch commended the chief consultant on the festival, Ayo Olumoko, for his selflessness and support in ensuring that the yearly festival holds. Olanipekun, however, solicited the support of states and the Federal Government as the Osun groove had been listed by UNESCO as a world heritage site. Mr Kufre Ekanem, the Corporate Affairs Adviser of Nigerian Breweries Plc, said the company had been partnering with the organisers of  the Osun- Osogbo festival. He added that the festival was worth identifying with as it had continued to put Nigeria on the world tourism map. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
