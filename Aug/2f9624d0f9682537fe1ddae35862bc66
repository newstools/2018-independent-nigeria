The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA) yesterday commended the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on agreement reached with the Bankers’ Committee, to offer single-digit interest rate loans to operators in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors of the economy. Mr. Olusegun Oshinowo, the Director-General of NECA, who commended the apex bank on new agreement, applauded the scheme, and noted that it would aid in the development of the real sector. Oshinowo, however, said that the scheme that is commencing with manufacturing and agricultural sectors should also be extended to other sectors of the economy, especially sectors that would create jobs for the teeming unemployed youths in the country. “We believe that the focus is to ensure the growth of the economy, especially now that we are out of recession and have achieved some stability,” he added. Oshinowo explained further that with transparency, proper structure and implementation, the scheme would enhance the economy’s growth, create more jobs, serve in the reduction of crimes and youth restiveness, adding that it would also improve the easy of doing business in the country. While commending the efforts by government, NECA advised it and the apex bank to ensure that the guidelines and requirements in accessing the loans were not over-reaching. NECA also urged operators in the real sector to take advantage of the scheme. Oshinowo, however, called on the Federal Government to develop and implement more business-friendly initiatives that would further entrench the private sector as the engine of national development. This, according to him, would demonstrate government’s avowed commitment to improving ease of doing business in the country. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
