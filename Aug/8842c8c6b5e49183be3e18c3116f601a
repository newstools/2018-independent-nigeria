The National Association of Telecommunications Subscribers (NATCOMS) has said that Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC)’s licensing of more infrastructure companies (InfraCos) was a proactive step toward achieving the 30 percent broadband penetration target. Mr. Adeola Ogunbanjo, National President of NATCOMS, made the disclosure in an interview with newsmen in Lagos on Wednesday. Nigeria developed a five-year strategy (2013- 2018) in 2013, through the Presidential Committee on Broadband. The aim is to drive Internet and broadband penetration in the country and to scale up NCC’s broadband growth by 30 per cent in 2018. He said, “We have only four months to go, and actually, the target cannot be met and that is what is worrying the NCC, which is leading to the licensing of more InfraCos. “Honestly, NCC is taking a good step in the right direction by ensuring licensing of more InfraCos, because it would lead to more expectations and more robust broadband penetration. “There is also the need for private sector’s participation to help the government to achieve this target,” Ogunbanjo said. He decried many obstacles hindering the actualisation of the broadband’s target such as the Right Of Way (ROW), many taxes and levies, saying that they should be looked into.
