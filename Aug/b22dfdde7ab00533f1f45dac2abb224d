A new space breeding research centre has been unveiled in
northwest China, with missions including applying space technology to cultivate quality tree
seedlings for the countryâ€™s well-known Three-North Shelter Forest Programme. Located in Yangling National Agricultural Demonstration Zone in Shanxi Province, the research centre
has been established by the Space Biology, a technological consultancy with China Academy of Space
Technology, in cooperation with a local plant cultivation company. Space breeding combines astronautics with agricultural sciences. Seeds are sent into space in a spacecraft. In the space environment, seeds may undergo mutation and after returning to Earth, mutated seeds are selected and planted to breed new varieties with a higher quality and yield. The centre, which also serves as a space seed breeding lab, will protect the returned seeds, conduct further selection and test them on Earth. The newly established center has been assigned by the National Forestry and Grassland Administration with an urgent task to send 20 tree species into space and cultivate quality tree seedlings for the Three-North Shelter Forest Programme which places forest windbreaks in North, Northwest and Northeast China, said a source of the Yangling zone. China has been working on space breeding technology for more than 30 years and has conducted more than 70 space breeding experiments, carrying more than 6,000 seeds into space, of which more than 230 have been successfully selected, including for crops, vegetables and flowers. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
