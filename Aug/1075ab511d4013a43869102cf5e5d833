Athletes have been praising some of the top sponsors of the 21st CAA Senior Athletics Championships in Asaba, Delta State. Zenith Bank who splashed N300m on the competition was applauded like other sponsors as Nigerian athletes said such supports would improve the sport in the country. Speaking with our correspondent, former junior international, Divine Oduduru, said Zenith Bank and other sponsors have done what they have been asking for as athletes and hopefully, others will follow suit and invest in athletics. “All the sponsors have done well and I really want to appreciate the support from Zenith Bank for this championship,” he said. “This is what we have been asking for all these years so that the game can regain its lost glory in the country.” In the same vein, national record holder in the women’s javelin throw, Kelechi Nwanaga, said the coming of sponsors like Zenith Bank was long overdue. According to her, such support will help the athletes at home to really trust in their ability and likewise go out to give their best. Other athletes like quarter miler, Orukpe Erayoikan, called on other corporate organisations to emulate Zenith Bank and other companies that invested in Asaba 2018. He added: “If others can decide to put their money in athletic events like the national trials, the golden league and the rest, it will help the country’s athletes especially the home-based. “The problem has been lack of competitions and if we can get sponsors like this, then we are going to be competing and be at the top like the rest athletes in Africa and world.” Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
