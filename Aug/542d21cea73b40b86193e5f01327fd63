LAGOS – Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has implored power distribution companies in the country to provide pre-paid meters to all homes in order to ensure that consumers get satisfaction for their service. He said that if every customer of the various Discos was provided a meter each, they would consume their electricity the way they wanted, and would reduce grievances against the Discos. He noted that the substation was a significant step in improving power supplies to different parts of Ondo and Ekiti States. He added that power was a critical requirement in economic growth, while its impact on education, health and other facets of life could not be quantified. He regretted the challenges being faced from erratic electricity supply by some communities in Ondo South and Ondo North Senatorial Districts, which he said had been cut-off from the national grid for several years.
