GUSAU – The Internally Displaced Persons (IDPS) in Zurmi, Maradun and Shinkafi Local Government areas have cried out that the government did not properly feed them. According to one of the persons in Zurmi camp, Muhammad Sani who spoke with newsmen at the Government Arabic Secondary School, in the past eight days, they only got food shared in the camp twice daily, which he said was not enough. Alhaji Sani said that, the situation has forced him to sell his goat to buy food for his family, adding that even the scanty food they shared was not good enough to be given to goats and animals. Many residents of the camps lamented their sad experiences, saying, they were seriously in dire need of essential commodities for their survival. Sunday INDEPENDENT gathered that the people were very much concerned about insufficient food being shared to them, saying that they hardly get two meals daily. Speaking with newsmen in Zurmi, Maradun and Shinkafi Local governments where the people were camped, they lamented that they sleep on floor without mats in the schools where they were camped. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
