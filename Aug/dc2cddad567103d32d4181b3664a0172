Samuel Ortom, Benue State governor, has commiserated with the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Benue State council over the death of its Chairman, Comrade David Ukuma. He described the death of Ukuma as painful, not only to his family and NUJ, but also to the state at large. He said: “Comrade David Ukuma was a promising leader and versatile broadcaster whose talent and selfless disposition will be dearly missed.” Ortom urged the deceased’s family and his colleagues at Radio Benue, as well as NUJ to take solace in the fact that the late Chairman lived a life worthy of emulation. He also prayed that God grant Ukuma eternal rest and his family the strength to bear the loss. Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
