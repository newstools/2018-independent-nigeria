FIFA has given Nigeria August 20, 2018 deadline to allow Amaju Pinnick and Mohammed Sanusi to administer Nigerian Football or face suspension. FIFA in a letter dated August 13, 2018 stated failure to do will amount to violation of art. 14 par. 1 i) and art. 19, as well as art. 14 par. 1 a) of the FIFA Statutes. It said that such suspension can only be lifted if these officials informed them officially that they’ve been allowed to administer Nigerian football. The decision by the Bureau of the FIFA Council, accused Nigeria of undue influence in the affairs of the Nigerian football. The letter reads, “Two decisions of the Bureau of the FIFA Council in relation to undue influence in the affairs of the Nigeria Football Federation and the Ghana Football Association have been notified on 13 August 2018. “In line with art. 16 par. 1 of the FIFA Statutes, the Bureau of the FIFA Council decided that if by Monday, 20 August 2018, at 12:00 (CET), the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) offices are not handed back to the legitimate NFF executive committee under President Amaju Melvin Pinnick, who was duly elected on 30 September 2014, the NFF will be suspended with immediate effect for contravening art. 14 par. 1 i) and art. 19, as well as art. 14 par. 1 a) of the FIFA Statutes. “The suspension would be lifted only once the NFF, under President Amaju Melvin Pinnick and General Secretary Mohammed Sanusi, confirms that it has been given back effective control of the NFF and its offices. “Furthermore, the Bureau decided that if the suspension of the NFF takes effect, the Nigerian team currently competing in the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup France 2018 will still be allowed to continue to participate in the tournament on an exceptional basis given that the tournament is underway.” comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
