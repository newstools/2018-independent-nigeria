GOMBE – Maina Laban Binus, the programme manager of the Gombe State Agricultural Development Programme (GADP), has challenged Nigerians to task politicians that will come seeking their votes in the 2019 elections to make food security a cardinal point in their programmes. Binus made the call at an advocacy campaign by Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) on the need to pass the right to food bill in the country. While addressing the rally in his office, he said, “Any politician coming to seek your votes towards 2019 election without making food security as a priority should be disregarded.” He said the ADP has always been in support of the actualization of the right to food policy which is the reason why their slogan had always remained “Food first”. Speaking in his residence when the group called on him, Gombe State Deputy Governor, Charles Iliya, commended the movement especially as it is being propagated by young people. He said Gombe State government under Alhaji Ibrhim Hasssan Dankwambo has always given agriculture the needed attention and priority, the reason why he feels the state should be addressed as the grains basket of the nation. He assured that considering the importance of the programme, the governor will be briefed and that government will do all within its powers to mobilise stakeholders to see that the bill scales through at the national level. He said, “We have a friendly food/agricultural policy in Gombe State as government takes care of all technical requirements of any farmer in the state who cultivates 10 hectares of land and above.” Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
