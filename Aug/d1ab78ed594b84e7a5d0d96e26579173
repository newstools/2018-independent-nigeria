China reiterated its willingness to maintain cooperation with Iran and rejected sanctions against that country, according to a foreign ministry statement quoted in the local press today. According to spokesman Lu Kang, China has had an open, transparent and normal commercial cooperation with Iran in the economy, trade, energy and other fields for a long time, which has not violated the resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations nor has undermined the interests of other countries. In this regard, Lu said that this collaboration must be respected and maintained. In addition, the spokesman urged the United States and the Islamic Republic to work in consultation based on the principle of equality and mutual respect. China believes that imposing or threatening to impose sanctions will not help solve the problems, while dialogue and consultation are better alternatives, he said. From this Tuesday on, Iran faces the first round of US sanctions against the automotive, aeronautical and banking sectors. A second stage, scheduled for November 5, will affect the energy sector. The president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, declared that his government will maintain firm positions against the threats with which the United States tries to prevent oil exports. On the other hand, countries like Russia, China, and Turkey will not comply with the sanctions of Washington and will maintain their trade with the Persian nation.  comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
