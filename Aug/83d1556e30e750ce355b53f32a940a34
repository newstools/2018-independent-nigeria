KAA Gent of Belgium summer arrival, Taiwo Awoniyi will be all out for redemption on Thursday, as he seeks to return to goals scoring form against Girondins- Bordeaux of France in the UEFA Europa League. The 21-year-old Awoniyi, who is on loan from Liverpool, started the first leg against Bordeaux, but failed to take his chances, including a four yard opportunity, and was subsequently replaced after 74 minutes. Another chance to make amends has come for Awoniyi, who scored his first goal for Gent in the same second-tier European competition, but is yet to hit target in five appearances with his new club in the Belgian league. Awoniyi will try to defy the odds of playing away in Thursday’s Europa League playoff, to ensure Gent’s fans finally forget his several misses that ensured the first leg in Belgium ended goalless.
