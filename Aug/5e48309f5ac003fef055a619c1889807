MAKURDI – General Adeyemi Yekini, Commander, Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS), has said it was “ever ready” to handle any incident of attacks during the Sallah break and beyond. This is just as Lt. Gen Tukur Buratai, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), is expected to chair the public presentation of a new Nigerian novel entitled, ‘Barrack Boy.’ Gen. Yekini declared that the troops of OPWS were battle ready for all armed militia in the state and its surroundings. He made the declaration while speaking with DAILY INDEPENDENT in Makurdi on Wednesday in reaction to the security alert issued out by the USSD to its staff. The security alert had advised staff of the USSD to be wary of attacks during the Sallah break and be security conscious at all times, particularly in crowded areas. Yekini also said that there was a likelihood of OPWS carrying out a military exercise to checkmate the activities of armed bandits within the Sallah period. He said, “On the issue of our preparedness, I am not in control of the whole of northern states of Nigeria. “My area of jurisdiction is just Nasarawa, Taraba and Benue states and if you observe, the tempo of our operations, we step up our operations anytime we are approaching any of these public holidays (including Sallah) because these are the time we normally have incidences of attacks. So, we are ever ready. Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
