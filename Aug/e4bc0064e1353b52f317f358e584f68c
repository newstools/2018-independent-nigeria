Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles coach, is hoping that the chance to win a second Africa Cup of Nations title could convince Victor Moses to reconsider his decision to retire from the international football. Moses, 27, stunned Nigerians when he announced his international retirement earlier this month, but Rohr is hopeful that the decision can still be reversed. “We spoke already and I hope that his decision is not definitive,” the German told KweséESPN. “I think it depends on his motivation. If he really wants to commit himself again, he is welcome. “Maybe the chance to win the Afcon is motivation. We will see.” Moses was a key member of the Super Eagles team that won a third African title for Nigeria in 2013, and the World Cup in Russia was his second for the country. The forward scored 12 goals in his 37 appearances for Nigeria, and provided a constant and potent threat for the Super Eagles whenever he played. His sudden retirement took even his teammates by surprise, including defender William Troost-Ekong, who told KweséESPN: “I didn’t expect it. “I was just as shocked as everyone else when I heard it. It is a massive loss for Nigeria because Victor has been fantastic for us. “I have only played with him the last year and a half. Everyone sees what he can do. But at the same time it would be exciting to see what other players stand up now. “Players come and go and it’s not one player that makes a team. I think it should be exciting for Nigeria to see what players stand up now.” Nigeria face Seychelles on 8 September on Matchday 2 of the 2019 Afcon qualifiers.
