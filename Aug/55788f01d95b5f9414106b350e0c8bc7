A 49-year-old man, Gbenga Olomilua, has urged a Grade C Customary Court sitting at Inalende, Ibadan, to uphold the divorce request of his wife, Rashidat, alleging that her promiscuity has no bound. Olomilua told the court on Wednesday that his 10-year-old union with the plaintiff was characterised with cheating, nagging and disrespect. “I married her when she was nothing. Although I didn’t pay her dowry, yet I took care of her and provided for all her needs to make her happy. “I work in Lagos, but I spend my weekends in Ibadan. Unfortunately, she used my absence as an opportunity to learn the acts of infidelity from her friends. “She is now an expert, whose promiscuity has reached an alarming stage. She hardly stays at home to take care of the two kids of our marriage. “She is fond of nagging, and she will never listen nor obey my instructions and command as the husband. “In this regard, her decision to end the marriage is a welcome development,” Olomilua stated. Rashidat, 32, had earlier prayed the court to dissolve her marriage on grounds of brutality and unrest of mind. Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
