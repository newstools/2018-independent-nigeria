OLAWALE SMART LAGOS – Mr. Shola Tinubu, President and the Chairman of the Governing Council, Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB), has warned that the recent drama on the political scene might be detrimental to the nation’s economy. Speaking with the media at the quarterly briefing organised by the Council in Lagos on Monday, Tinubu noted that a stable polity is a bedrock for any socio-economic development expected in Nigeria. He said, “As we are all aware, the country’s political process is gathering momentum towards the 2019 General elections. Though as a professional body, we must stay above party politics but are duty bound to positively impact on our political environment as it must not elude us that economy and politics are inextricably woven. “The council would like to use this medium to enjoin politicians to endeavour not to overheat the polity in view of the potential negative effects of such actions on the socio-economic development of the nation. “There is no better catalyst for investment in any economy than the stability of the polity. Therefore, we enjoin our politicians to make the welfare and progress of the nation and its people their primary agenda and the focus of their noted actions,” he said. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
