The company said that total revenues increased by 9.7 per cent to ZAR 505.67 billion in the first six months to 30 June from ZAR 432.28 billion in the same period in 2017. Service revenue increased by 10.2 percent,  supported by growth in MTN Nigeria (up 17.0%), MTN Ghana (up 27.9%), MTN South Africa (up 2.9%) and MTN Uganda (up 8.8%).  MTN Cameroon and MTN Ivory Coast reported 7.0 percent and 6.6 percent declines in service revenue respectively. Net profit increased to ZAR 73.39 billion from ZAR 40.64 billion in 2017. The group ended June with 223.4 million subscribers, up by 2.1 million from the end of March, and 71.2 million active data users. The number of active MTN Mobile Money customers increased to 24.1 million from 22.7 million three months earlier. Group EBITDA increased by 17.0 percent to ZAR 217.87 billion in the first half, driven by increases of 31.5 percent, 5.7 percent and 34.7 percent at MTN Nigeria, MTN South Africa and MTN Ghana respectively and lower head office costs, which were partially offset by the performance of the WECA markets. The group EBITDA margin increased by 2.2 percentage points to 35.5 percent. The group depreciation charge increased by 10.2 percent because of higher capex over the past few years. Amortisation costs rose by 17.6 percent, after higher expenditure on software in the previous period. Net forex losses declined by 60.3 percent because of lower losses in Nigeria after the operation settled a number of foreign-denominated expenses. In a related development, MTN Nigeria’s EBITDA increased by 31.5 percent to N241,752,561,750.00 (ZAR 9.09 billion) in the first six months to 30 June year on year. The EBITDA margin increased by 4.7 percentage points to 43.0 percent. MTN Nigeria performed ahead of expectations, with double-digit growth in voice revenue driving accelerated service revenue growth and the widening of the EBITDA margin. Service and digital revenues increased by 17.0 percent and 63.7 percent respectively, and capex rose by 0.5 percent. Increased usage and growth in data subscribers supported data revenue growth. Digital revenue declined as a result the optimisation of its value-added services (VAS) business. Towards the end of the second quarter, net additions and revenue growth slowed in line with economic activity, as well as some seasonality. The group expects this trend to continue in the third quarter, with an improved performance expected in the fourth quarter. The subscriber base expanded by 5.6 percent from December 2017 to 55.2 million. MTN deployed a total of 3,603 3G and 3,660 4G co-located sites during the six months to end-June 2018, resulting ‘in a marked improvement in network quality and capacity across a number of our markets’. MTN reported headline earnings per share (HEPS) of ZAR 2.15 compared with ZAR 2.31 in the comparable period. HEPS were hit by a swing of ZAR 0.21 in associates and joint ventures, as well as ZAR 0.17 relating to the Nigeria fine interest (from ZAR 0.24 in H1 2017); hyperinflation (excluding impairments) of ZAR 0.27 (from ZAR 0.42 in H1 2017); and the impact of foreign exchange losses and gains of ZAR 0.21 (from ZAR 0.49 in H1 2017). Excluding these items, HEPS fell to ZAR 2.80 from ZAR 3.46. Capex increased by 20.0 percent for the first half to ZAR 11.46 billion. MTN said it expects to spend around ZAR 25.5 billion over the full year. The company also declared an interim dividend of ZAR 1.75 per share.
