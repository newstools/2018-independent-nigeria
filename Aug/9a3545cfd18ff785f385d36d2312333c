Lagos – Manu Garba, Golden Eaglets coach, has written off the new format for the U17 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers as capable of stopping the team from qualifying for next year’s cadet championship in Tanzania. Rather, the coach has embraced the challenge of competing in the new format, insisting that the Eaglets have the quality to come through. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) had adopted a zonal qualification system for the 2019 Africa U-17 Cup of Nations, the 13th edition of the competition. Only one team qualifies from each Zone in the new format, aside the host. In the West B Zone, Nigeria will vie for a spot from group B against Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Benin. The top two teams will progress to the semi-final, where they face the semi-finalists from Group A. Although Nigeria is the most successful nation at the World stage in the U17s, the Eaglets have only won the African championship twice. West B Zone qualifiers kick off on September 2 in Niamey, Niger Republic. Nigeria plays Burkina Faso in their opening match on September 3. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
