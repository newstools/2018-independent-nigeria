AYO BADA Lagos – The leadership tussle in Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) will continue on Wednesday (today) August 1 as the Federal High Court in Jos will sit on the case. In contrast with wide spread hope that the case would eventually be vacated on Monday, in order to avert a possible hammer from world soccer governing body, FIFA, the Jos Court adjourned hearing of the matter till Wednesday (today0. The Tin City court stated on Monday that it will sit on Wednesday (today) for hearing of the motion to vacate it previous orders granting recognition to Chris Giwa to lead the NFF while invalidating the process that brought in Amaju Pinnick as the soccer governing body’s president. Pinnick’s lawyers had filed a counter-motion to dismiss the orders, and the court has fixed Wednesday (today) for hearing of their plea. It would be recalled that last July 12, the court failed to stop Giwa from occupying the Glass House of the NFF’s headquarters as requested by Pinnick. The development was sequel to the inability of Pinnick’s legal team to press for the vacation of ex-parte order of the court, which recognised Giwa as the authentic president of NFF. Justice Musa Kurya, the presiding judge of a Jos High Court, in the case between Yahaya Adama and Aminu Maigari and three others had on June 5 made an order asking Pinnick to vacate the Glass House for Giwa. However, about four weeks ago, Giwa’s group stormed the NFF Secretariat and took control on the strength of a court ruling, but on Monday, July 23, Giwa was asked to vacate the seat by the government. The government said that it gave the order because Nigeria would respect world football governing body’s position on the matter, which recognised Pinnick as the President of NFF.
