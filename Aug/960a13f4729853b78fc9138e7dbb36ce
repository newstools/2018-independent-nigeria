Osogbo – Chief Gani Adams, the Aare Onakakanfo was one of the dignitaries that thronged the grooves of Osun Osogbo for the grand finale of 2018 annual festival which was witnessed by both local and foreign tourists. Adams is witnessing the cultural festival for the first time as Aare Onakakanfo. He has been witnessing the event in the past along with hundreds of the members of outlawed Oodua People’s Congress (OPC). Chief Adams is one of the worshippers of Osun Osogbo festival and had been taking prominent roles in the past at the event. His presence and others made the occasion eventful aside roles played by Osun devotees, masquerades, traditional religion heads. The traditionalists and royal fathers paid homage to the Ataoja of Osogboland, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun (the host of the festival at the Osun-Osogbo), at the groove. Govenor Rauf Aregbesola of Osun, in his remarks at the occasion, said the state government would continue to support the festival for its sustainability and growth. Aregbesola who was represented by the state Commissioner for Home Affairs, Dr Olawale Adebisi, said the festival was important to his government for three key reasons. He said the first reason was that the Osun-Osogbo festival provides the largest platform and gathering, where tradition and culture can be exhibited and displayed to the outside world. “It is also the largest gathering of youths, so it provides a channel for transfer of culture and tradition to the younger generation. “While lastly, it brings about economic development, as tourists who come for the festival would lodge and spend their money, which improves the state economy.” He called on the host, Oba Olanipekun to use the occasion to pray for Nigeria and Osun, especially as governorship election in the state draws nearer. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
