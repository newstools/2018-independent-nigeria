The National Women’s Senior National team failed to arrive in Lagos onTuesday again due to logistic reasons. According to an earlier schedule, the D’Tigress who are currently in Atlanta, USA were meant to arrive Tuesday night in continuation of their FIBA 2018 World Cup preparation in Lagos. The Nigeria Basketball Federation said due to unavailability of suitable flight arrangements for the team; they could not leave their base in Atlanta as planned. NBBF board member, Col. Sam Ahmedu, who is with the team said, “There are no suitable flights as their travel plans are being done all the way to Spain for ease of movement of the players.” Since the team’s movement is hinged on availability of flight, no tentative date has been fixed by the federation for the team’s arrival in Lagos. “We are aware that a lot of people are eager to see the team train back home, but the continued delay is nobody’s fault”, Ahmedu continued. He assured that the delay would in no way affect their training as Coach Otis Hughley has continued with their training sessions as they await the next directive. The African champions will tip off their World Cup campaign against Australia on Saturday, September 22 at the Arena Santiago Martin, San Cristobal De La Laguna, Spain. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
