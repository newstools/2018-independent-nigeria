A German journalist who is on trial in Turkey on terror-related charges has returned to Germany after a Turkish court ruled that she could leave the country.  German news agency dpa reported that Mesale Tolu landed in Stuttgart on Sunday. Earlier Sunday, Tolu tweeted a photograph of herself and her young son at a Turkish airport with the words “going home after 17 months.”  Tolu has been charged with engaging in terrorist propaganda and being a member of a banned left-wing group, the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party. She rejects the accusations.  She was released from prison in December while the trial continued, but a court only recently lifted an exit ban. When the court’s move became public, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas called it “a step toward improving our relations with Turkey.” Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
