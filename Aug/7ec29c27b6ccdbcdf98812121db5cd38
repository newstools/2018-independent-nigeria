Nnewi – A non-governmental organisation (NGO) that caters to for the needy, widows, disabled people, sick and other less privileged in society “Onyemaechi Hope for the Helpless Foundation (OHFHF), has appealed to the Enugu State Governor, Chief Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, to urgently come to aid of Ohuani Amagunze community in Nkanu East Local Government Area of the state by constructing a link bridge over Inyaba river bridge at Amuzam Umunevo area of the community. It noted that the deplorable condition of the bridge, which has wood platform and was unpassable during rainy seasons, has cut off the community from the rest of ohers in the state. Disclosing this to newsmen while speaking on the foundation plan to organize an empowerment programme in the community in this year December in Nnewi last Wednesday, Nze Kennedy Onyema Okenwa, the founder of the foundation, who is an indigene of the community, said that apart from the link bridge, he said the community also needs hospital, potable drinking water, electricity and others, adding that lack of health facilities in the area has led to many deaths among his people. He said that it takes about three hours to access treatment in the neighbouring village, which has a hospital even as he said that agricultural products being produced by his people are not evacuated to the cities as a result of lack of access road. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
