Onitsha –  The Progressives People Alliance (PPA) has blamed insecurity and impunity by the All Progressives Congress (APC) led-government for joining the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) ahead of 2019 general elections. Godwin Ezeemo, national leader of the party, made this known on Friday in an interview with newsmen in Umuchu, Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra. “All that is important in the coalition is to see that we raise a leadership that will be sensitive to development, security, and issues affecting the people. “That is not to say we will write APC off completely; there are few areas they did well but below the pass mark level. “In the area of security; I am displeased with the way Nigerians are killed all over the country. It is not fair. “Any government that fails to provide security for the people is not worth being there at all. “We have equally seen that impunity remains a big issue in the current administration that allows a few to rule instead of adhering to the will of the people. “The unfair treatment and the use of security and graft agencies against political opponents by the APC led-Federal Government is to say the least of its shortcomings,” he said. However, Ezeemo, a former governorship candidate of the party in the state said “we will give the party half credit in its fight against corruption because they started half way and left it half way. “It does not make sense of the whole effort in the fight against corruption that the fight is now been used to make politicians join the party. “No administration has started the fight against corruption, but while APC started it, it has not been able to finish even one case,” he said. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
