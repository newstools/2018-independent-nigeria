Yola – Alhaji Umaru Adamu Sanda, paramount ruler and Gangwari Ganye in Adamawa State, has criticised former political office holders for neglecting the roads in his domain, while he was in power. Speaking during the flag-off of Mayo-Belwa-Jada-Ganye- Toungo road, Alhaji Sanda said many sons of the community neglected the area when they were in power only for Buhari to come to the aid of the area after more than 20 years. Essentially, he blamed the former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, an indigene, for not doing much for the community despite the fact that he hails from the area. The Gangwari Ganye said it was shameful that prominent sons of the area were in position but neglected their area only for President Muhammadu Buhari to come to the aid of Ganye Chiefdom. He poured encomiums on Buhari for awarding the road contract, which the indigenes of the area deliberately neglected for selfish reasons. Also speaking, a member of the House of Representatives, Hon Namdaz Abdulrazak said the road had been in the state of disrepair for more than 20 years, with many lives to accidents, before the Buhari administration decided to reconstruct it. He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for remembering the people of his constituency by awarding the road project, which would be completed in 14 months.
