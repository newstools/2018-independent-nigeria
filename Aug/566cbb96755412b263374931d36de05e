JOY ANIGBOGU LAGOS – Bolanle Ambode, wife of the Lagos State governor, has said that proper upbringing of children remained the solution to fight corruption in the society. Mrs. Ambode maintained that women were in strategic position by the role they played as moulders of character and constitute a front by discouraging any act, behaviour and attitude that could aid corrupt tendencies The Lagos first lady, who was a special guest of honour at a one-day conference on fight against corruption with the theme: ‘The Role of Women in Fight Against Corruption’, spoke through Mrs. Titilayo Oyilola, which took place in Ikeja, Lagos. “If we succeed individually in our homes, there will be no room for corruption and corrupt practices in the larger society. We must view corruption as a manifestation of decadent morals, compelling us to pay greater attention to the home front for better upbringing of children along values of honesty, integrity, hard work, fear of God and dignity of labour,” she said. Dr Francis Shopekan, founder and president of Fight Against Corruption Organization (FACO), a non-governmental organisation (NGO), said that involving women and engaging youths were the recipe for a successful fight against corruption in the society because women were home builders and youths, when fully engaged, would not indulge in criminality. Professor Ibiyemi Olatunji-Bello, former Deputy Vice Chancellor, Lagos State University (LASU), said the youth should guide against being used by politicians as thugs in elections because of penchant for criminality and financial inducements. She pointed out that mothers had a big role to play in counselling their children, adding that students should avoid sexual abuse, examination malpractices and cultism.
