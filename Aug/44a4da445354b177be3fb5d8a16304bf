The Minot Air Force Base says the 22-year-old man killed in a motorcycle crash over the weekend was a senior airman. Col. Bradley Cochran, the 5th Bomb Wing commander, says they are pausing to remember Jacob Ellis and are reflecting on his service. Ellis was killed when his motorcycle collided with an SUV Friday night in Minot. Ellis was thrown from his motorcycle and was pronounced dead shortly after the crash. Both vehicles caught fire. Several occupants of the SUV sustained serious but non-life-threatening injuries and were taken by personal vehicle to a Minot hospital. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
