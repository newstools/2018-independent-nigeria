Lagos – Victor Anichebe, former Super Eagles forward, has praised Super Eagles players, noting that they have ‘insane’ and incredible talents to excel with proper guidance. Anichebe, who last played for the national team six years ago, where he was capped eleven times with a goal, said that the current players need proper guidance and nurturing to make them do great things. Nigeria will play Seychelles on September 7 in Victoria in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier having lost their first game 2-0 in Uyo to South Africa. “The talent we have is insane; they just need guidance and nurturing. The future is bright,” Anichebe said while responding to questions on his Instagram status page. “I really believe that Nigeria should bring more ex-players like Yakubu Aiyegbeni and Osaze Odemwingie and others on board to help this great young squad as they have played to the highest level and know how to cope with pressure and expectations.” He explained why he has been inactive for over a season since he joined Chinese second division side, Beijing Enterprises, labelling it the worst setback in his football career. The 30 year old striker joined the CSL team in 2017 on a free after a one-year stint with Sunderland. The former West Brom and Everton star reveals that it was down to the unethical practice of the Chinese club. “Honestly, I think it’s this period I’ve been away from football. Simply down to an unethical Beijing Enterprises. “I know everyone will expect me to say an injury, but that’s part of the game.” Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
