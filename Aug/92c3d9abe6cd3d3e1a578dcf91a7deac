Super Eagles technical adviser, Gernot Rohr has disclosed that he plans to prepare adequately for the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Seychelles next month. According to him, he will hit the ground running with invited players once they arrive in camp on September 2, because it is very important that they beat Seychelles. Having lost their first match of the Africa Cup of Nations, 2-0 at home to South Africa, Rohr acknowledged that the Super Eagles cannot afford another slip and stressed that beating Seychelles on September 7 was his main target for now. While also looking to the future, especially with an international friendly against Saudi Arabia looming, the Franco-German coach said that he would only talk about trying out new players after the upcoming crucial clash away to Seychelles. Rohr said: “We lost our first game against South Africa in June last year and the next game against Seychelles is very important to us. After that, we will play two back-to-back games against Libya. “Seychelles, I believe, have a very good team, so we have to prepare well to beat them. Then after that, we want to play Saudi Arabia on September 11, which will be a good chance to try some new players. “The game against Seychelles is a crucial one and we won’t have longer time to prepare for it, so there is no real chance to try out new players, but we hope to do that in friendlies. It’s a game we can’t afford to lose.” Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
