Lagos – Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles coach has given reasons why he included Odion Ighalo in his 24-man list for the Africa Cup of Nations qualifying game against Seychelles on September 7, 2018 in Victoria. He said at the weekend in Lagos that he want Ighalo to prove to his critics that he has not lost his goal scoring form for the Super Eagles. Ighalo has come under criticism after failing to score a goal in three games for the team at the just concluded World Cup in Russia. His failure has been ascribed for the Super Eagles crashing out of the tournament at the group stage. But Rohr wants to prove to Nigerians that the player has what it takes to qualify the team for the Africa Cup of Nations holding in Cameroon next year. “I want him to come and prove his critics wrong. I want him to come and prove that he can still score goals, especially for the team,” the coach said. “I want to give him opportunity to prove that he can still score goals for the Super Eagles. He is scoring for his club in China.” Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
