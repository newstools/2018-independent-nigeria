The US sanctions against Russia that will come into force on August 22 are unlawful. They negatively affect international trade, Russian President’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov told Kommersant FM radio. He also stressed that “such restrictions will certainly affect the entire international trade.” “We are aware that the bill has been prepared. We are familiar with the content of the bill. It has been published on their internet resources. We have carefully studied it and we consider that it is the continuation of unfriendly and illegal actions from the point of view of international law,” said Peskov. On August 8, the US State Department announced new sanctions against Russia because of the poisoning of former Colonel GRU Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, Great Britain. The first package of restrictions will come into force on August 22 and will affect the supply of defense industry products. The second package of sanctions may be introduced in a few months if Russia does not guarantee that it will not use chemical and biological weapons. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
