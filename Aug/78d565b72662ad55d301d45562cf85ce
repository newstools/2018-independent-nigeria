Officials  on Friday said 28 people have died in accidents brought on by torrential rains in India’s southern state of Kerala even as thousands were moved to shelters. Six more deaths were reported since Thursday, bringing the death toll to 28, with 12 fatalities confirmed in the hilly district of Idukki, officials at the state disaster management control room said. Kerala has been pounded by heavy rains since Wednesday. Officials said most of the deaths were due to landslides and drowning. As many as 20,000 people were rescued from villages in low-lying areas and were housed in 260 relief camps set up by the government. Domestic media reported that 69 tourists, including 20 foreigners, were stranded at a private resort in the popular tea county of Munnar in Idukki. The roads leading to the resort were blocked due to landslides and the army had been called to help tourists evacuate from the Plum Judy resort. The official said waters had to be released from 24 dams due to rising water levels and this was causing flooding downstream. India’s monsoon season between June and September often sees heavy rains that are vital for agriculture but can cause immense destruction. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
