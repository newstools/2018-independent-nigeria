LAGOS – The Zone A office of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Post Clearance Audit (PCA) unit, has recovered a total of N8.6bn between January and June, 2018. The recovery is N2.6bn above the N6.bn earned the same period last year. This was disclosed yesterday by Mr. Abba Kura, Customs Comptroller in charge of the unit during the visit of Aminu Dahiru, Assistant Comptroller-General and Zonal Coordinator for Zone A. Kura told Dahiru that in addition to what had been collected, the unit had uncovered another N2bn underpayment in respect of a single transaction and that after several attempts to argue it away, the defaulting company would be made to pay. He said the payment was coming after the Customs headquarters resolved the dispute between the unit and the defaulting company in favour of the Lagos PCA Unit. Dahiru commended the Controller and his team for ensuring that government revenue was not lost even after goods had exited the ports down to the importers warehouses, while lauding his competence on the post clearance audit job. He described the function of the unit as sensitive in the service quest for maximum revenue collection considering that the highest volume of trade processed by the customs was recorded within the Lagos area.
