Lagos – After two days of qualifying rounds, the top seeds at the 2018 ITTF Challenge Seamaster Nigeria Open will begin their campaigns for honours at the $46.000 prize money championship. With the arrival of number one seed, Aruna Quadri, attention will turn to the main draw of the men’s and women’s singles events as tournament enters knockout stage. According to ITTF Publication Manager, Ian Marshal, “it is not only the fact that Quadri tops the list, which puts him in the spotlight, it is the way that he plays and the way he conducts himself.” Focus will be on Aruna and Segun Toriola but they will have to be at their best, because of strong European challenge, especially from France. Alexandre Robinot, the reigning national champion, leads the invasion. He is supported by Antoine Hachard, Joe Seyfried and Benjamin Brossier. Notably Antoine Hachard secured the Men’s Singles title on the ITTF World Tour in 2016 in Chile; in Under 21 Men’s Singles events, Joe Seyfried won earlier this year in Germany, in 2015 Benjamin Brossier prevailed in Qatar. Russia’s Alexey Liventsov, a quarterfinalist last year in Slovenia is on duty in Lagos, as is the 2016 champion, Finland’s Benedek Olah. Likewise, England’s Sam Walker, who finished in fourth place earlier this year in the Men’s Singles event at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games, is named on the entry list. Prominent names from the old continent and from the new. Brazil’s Thiago Monteiro leads the Latin American challenge; Argentina’s Horacio Cifuentes also makes the journey from the southern hemisphere. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
