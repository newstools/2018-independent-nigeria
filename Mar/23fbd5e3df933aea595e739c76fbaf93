Volkswagen has said it is bringing a five-passenger Atlas Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) concept to the 2018 New York Auto Show. Like its three-row and seven-seat sibling, the two-row SUV, the auto company said would also be assembled in the U.S. and rides on VW’s scalable MQB platform. “The Atlas has built strong momentum for Volkswagen in the SUV segment, and we are excited to grow our SUV portfolio with this new, Chattanooga-assembled five-passenger SUV,” said Hinrich J. Woebcken, Volkswagen Presiden in a statement. “We are not only committed to this market, we are committed to our U.S. manufacturing home in Chattanooga, Tennessee.” Volkswagen states that it would invest about $340 million to bring the  new five-passenger Atlas variant to market. It’s the third Volkswagen model assembled at the company’s Chattanooga factory. The current Atlas is available with a 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine for the base model that delivers 235 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque. The optional 3.6-liter V-6 engine offers 276 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, with Volkwagen’s 4Motion all-wheel-drive system available as an option. The five-passenger Atlas variant will likely offer the same engine options. Volkswagen sold 27,119 seven-passenger Atlases last year. VW’s latest concept SUV would make its official debut at the New York auto show next week. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
