Lagos – Christian Chukwu (MON), former Super Eagles handler has said that the scandalous defeat of MFM FC of Lagos in the 2018 CAF Champions League over the weekend was an embarrassment to Nigeria as a football nation. Chukwu believed that it was not a good result for the Lagos side who were beaten 0-6 by MC Algers of Algiers in the second leg of the African prestigious club championship on Saturday. “I can’t imagine a Nigerian club at the club championship level in African football going down so cheap 6-0! It was an embarrassment to Nigeria. We (Nigerian clubs) should at this age not be intimidated by any country in football. “If they could defeat the Algerian side at home (2-1), it was expected that they should have been able to put up some efforts to get a respectable result even if they were defeated 3-1, 3-2 or so,” Chukwu said. Chukwu however was quick to give the club a pat on the back saying, “Well, inexperience maybe one of the problems that affected their performance; when they return to Nigeria, we will hear from them what actually transpired. The former Rangers General Manager concluded, “MFM should now see how they can use this defeat to mirror their games in the CAF Confederations Cup which is the next stage for them.” 0 comments
