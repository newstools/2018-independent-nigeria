Lagos – Federal Operations Unit, (FOU), of the Nigeria Customs Service, Zone A,  Ikeja, Lagos, says one Mr. KO Sin Yin, a Chinese National, was among the suspects arrested for his alleged involvement in smuggling activities. Sixteen Nigerians were also arrested by the Customs operatives, even as the agency intercepted various contrabands valued at over N1.03billlion in the month of February, this year. Mohammed Uba Garba, Comptroller of the unit, told newsmen in Lagos on Wednesday that the seized items were: 18 assorted vehicles, 4,201 bags of foreign parboiled rice, 2637 cartons of frozen poultry products, 1,105 jerry cans of vegetable oil, 2,637 pieces of used tyres,  1,333 bales of used cloths, 2,001 kg of pangolin and 343kg of elephant tusks, among others. Garba further explained that one Rolls Royce, one Chrysler, one Audi, one Land Rover HSE, one Toyota Venza, one Ford Taurus, one Honda Cross Tour, four Mercedes Banz, three Kia Rio, one Escalade, were some of the vehicles impounded by the service. According to the Lagos Customs Boss, some of the vehicles were intercepted along Ijebu-Ode Expressway and Lekki, in Lagos. His words: “In the month under review, the warehouse operations team led by Assistant Comptroller, Mutalib Sule, while on intelligence mission, raided an apartment at No 38, Ogunlana Street, Ikeja, Lagos, and evacuated  55 sacks of pangolin shells, weighing 2001kg and valued at N408,319,317.6,  and 218 pieces of elephant tusk weighing 343kg and valued at N85,156,649.96” “You will recall that the responsibilities of the Customs have increased tremendously overtime because of the implementation of different international protocols and conventions.” The convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES 1973), entails that Customs Administration globally protects wild life by intercepting illegal trade on such animals and further prevents the killings of endangered species. In the spirit of inter-agency collaboration, the seized pangolin and tusks have been handed over to the Nigeria Environmental Standards and Regulatory Enforcement Agency (NESREA), for further investigation in collaboration with protecting our natural habitat,” Uba said. Also, a 1x20ft container number CAIU0961053 was seized for false declaration, which is tantamount to seizure. Seventeen suspects have been arrested in connection with these ninety seizures including Mr. KO Sin Ying, a Chinese national.” He further disclosed that the Unit received N67, 945,158.00 from Demand Notices(DN), raised on goods intercepted while attempting to beat the system through transfer of valuable and under-declaration, making a cumulative of N1,103,177,204. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
