Abuja – Prof. Issac Adewole, Minister of Health, has urged journalists to write, investigate stories, expose the wrong and bring out the facts. Adewole said that health is a collective responsibility and his role is to coordinate everybody including the journalists. He said, “If people have the right information and live right, diseases burden will be reduced.” He stated this at a capacity building training for journalists in Abuja on health reporting organised by World Health Organisation (WHO) in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health. The training is to equip journalists in Nigeria to report on regular basis, WHO’s role in supporting government’s health agenda, management of humanitarian crises, health emergencies and build skills for reporting other health issues. He was however in support of the Health Journalists Award organised by WHO and promised to sponsor one category. Earlier, the WHO Country Representative to Nigeria, Dr. Wondimagegehu Alemu said, “We contribute our own share towards improvement of Nigerians health.” According to him, Health is not only about disease, but also about wellbeing. The promotion of health and prevention is very critical. He added that, “Working with the media will best address that situation. The story may come but what is important is how the story helps in the well being and development of society.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
