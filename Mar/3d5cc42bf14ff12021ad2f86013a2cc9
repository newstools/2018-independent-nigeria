FC Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has the talent and maturity to carry Argentina’s hopes of a successful summer World Cup campaign in Russia, the national team’s manager Jorge Sampaoli says. Two-time winners Argentina open their World Cup campaign with a Group D encounter against Iceland on June 16, and will also face Croatia and Nigeria in the pool stage. Five-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi has led Spanish clubside FC Barcelona to 30 domestic and European trophies during a stellar career. But he is yet to win a major trophy with the national team, apart from a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics. Argentina finished runners-up to Germany at the 2014 World Cup and to Chile at the 2015 and 2016 Copa America tournaments. Sampaoli believes that Messi can help the team go one step further and end their trophy drought in Russia. “This is going to be his team,” Sampaoli told a news conference. “He is the best of all and is in a stage of maturity that he can carry the team on his shoulders. This is going to be his team.” Messi initially announced his retirement from international football after the loss to Chile in 2016, but the 30-year-old has since reversed his decision. He is the all-time top goal-scorer for both club and country. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
