Lagos – Flying Eagles of Nigeria will play Junior Pharaohs of Egypt in another friendly at the El Borg Stadium in Alexandria, Egypt. On Monday at the same venue, both teams played a goalless draw in their first meeting and today’s second meeting is expected to produce a winner.
The game is part of the Flying Eagles preparations for the 2019 U-20 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.
The Flying Eagles captained by Enyimba’s Ikouwen Utin failed to create scoring chances during the first encounter but Nigerians expect to see changes in today’s encounter.
The trio of Elkanemi Warriors’ Nur Mohammed, Ikouwem Utin of Enyimba FC and Plateau United’s Eneji Moses, who impressed with the Super Eagles B at the African Nations Championship (CHAN) in Morocco earlier in the year, are expected to bring their experience into play and win the game for the Flying Eagles.
Kano Pillars’ Nazifi Yahaya, Nasarawa United’s Douglas Achiv and Akwa United’s duo of Duarw Nuhu and Adeshina Gata are also in this group.
Flying Eagles will play winners of the first round of the tie between Sierra Leone and Guinea Bissau after being drawn bye in the Niger 2019 U-20 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers.
Guinea Bissau will host Sierra Leone between March 30 and April 1 and travel to Freetown for the return leg scheduled for April 20- 22.
The Flying Eagles will then play the winner of this first round tie on May 11, 12 or 13 and the return leg in Nigeria will be played between 18, 19, and 20 of May 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
