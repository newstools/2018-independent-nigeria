Gombe – Women in Gombe State have appealed to the Gombe State government and other stakeholders to hasten and support the passage of the Gender and Equal Opportunity for All Persons Bill. The women are also calling for the establishment of Peace and Dialogue Agency in the state. Gombe State Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Welfare, Mrs. Rabi Daniel, made the position of the women known during a press briefing to mark this year’s International Women Day. Represented by the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Malam Ishaku Suleiman Mohammad, she said the Gombe State Gender and Equal Opportunities for All Persons Bill was not about equality of men and women to rub shoulders but to create a space for women to have equal chances with their male counterpart in terms of access to services. The Commissioner explained that, the state government and UN Women had held series of sensitisation and engagement programmes with stakeholders, saying, this was the time to set the process of change in motion so that collectively, “we can drive Gombe State to the next level of political and socioeconomic development.” Daniel said the state was able to domesticate the National Action Plan NAP on the implementation of UNSCR 1325 by developing and launching of the State Action Plan SAP for the implementation of UNSCR 1325 in the state. While wishing women all over the world a happy celebration, the Commissioner also commended the Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill Committee members for working tirelessly on the draft of the bill, advocacy and sensitization carried out from 2016 to date. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
