I am one to argue that one should only endorse what they believe in. It should be ‘do as I do’ and not just ‘do as I say’. If an actor or musician endorses a product and even advertise for the product, if that product turns out to be a fake or bad, the celebrity has to take part of the fallout. Many people would not have bought the product without their endorsement. Same thing goes for celebrities who endorse politicians. They collect millions from politicians and turn around to tell people to vote for these politicians. When these politicians fail the people, the celebrities also should be apportioned some of the blame. So, when Fuji artiste, Wasiu Ayinde Marshall visited the vice president during the week, I was shocked at the reason for his visit. The musician claims that he went to see the number two citizen of the country to echo the feelings of the people to him on the state of nation. He said that there is need for improvement in the lives of the citizenry. I am surprised this can be coming from the self-made King of Fuji music. This was the same man that was campaigning for this government before the elections. He told every one of his fans that everything will be fine after the president is voted in. Why is he now complaining that all is not well? Has he finally realised that he misinformed people? 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
