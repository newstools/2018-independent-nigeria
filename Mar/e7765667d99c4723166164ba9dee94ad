Russia sees no progress, only regress, in resolution with the United Kingdom of the issue of poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday. “There is only regress, we see no progress,” Lavrov said when asked whether there was any progress in London providing a sample of the substance used to poison Skripal to Russia. According to the minister, Russia received no official request from Londonon the issue of the Skripal case. He added that Russia had no motives to poison the former intelligence officer. He said Russia and the UK have to hold consultations on the issue of poisoning of Skripal. This, he said, is obligatory. “We calmly explained once again that the option of holding consultations in accordance with the [Chemical Weapons] Convention is not optional, it is obligatory,” Lavrov said. Lavrove also said that Russia will respond within 10 days if it receives an official request on the case. “As soon as we receive an official request, we, in accordance with our obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, will respond within 10 days,” Lavrov told reporters. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
