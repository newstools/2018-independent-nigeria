Three people have died in a residential building fire that caused residents to jump from windows. MassLive.com reports the fire broke out shortly before 7:30 a.m. Sunday. They found residents jumping out of second- and third-story windows to escape the flames. High winds caused the fire to spread. Fire officials say four people, including a pregnant woman and a child, were taken to local hospitals with injuries not believed to be life-threatening. Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno says the city is working with the local American Red Cross officials to find temporary housing for 60 to 80 people displaced by the fire. The cause is still under investigation. Springfield is about 90 miles (145 kilometers) west of Boston. 1 comments
