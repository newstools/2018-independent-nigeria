Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman is to visit Egypt in his first public foreign trip since becoming crown prince in 2017 , an Egyptian official and Cairo airport sources said on Friday. The visit, in the coming days, comes before he travels to London on March 7 and the U.S., Riyadh’s closest Western ally, on March 19. Bin Salman purged the Gulf Arab kingdom’s economic and political elite in a crackdown on corruption in 2017, after becoming crown prince in June. Riyadh counts Cairo among its Arab allies. Egypt supports it in a war against Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen and joined a trade and diplomatic boycott of Gulf state Qatar last year. A Saudi government spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Egypt visit. The Egyptian official gave no further details. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
