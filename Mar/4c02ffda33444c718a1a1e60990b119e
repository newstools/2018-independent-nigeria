Agege community of Lagos State on Thursday unanimously endorsed Akinwunmi Ambode, the state governor; Mudashiru Obasa, House of Assembly speaker; and Oluyinka Ogundimu, representing Agege Constituency 2 in the House of Assembly for another term in office. The community at a rally agreed that the trio should be supported to return to their offices to continue their laudable performances. Funsho Ologunde, Vice Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) for Lagos West; Professor Tunde Samuel, APC chieftain; and member of the Governor’s Advisory Committee (GAC); Mrs. Folashade Tinubu-Ojo, the Iyaloja General of Lagos State, who spoke at the event confirmed that in view of the huge achievements of the Ambode administration, particularly in Agege, it becomes imperative for Agege people to endorse not only Ambode but Obasa and Ogundimu, both of who have been playing supportive roles to Ambode. “Ambode has turned Lagos to a construction site and Agege community has been one of the major beneficiaries of the current administration in the state. Both Obasa and Ogundimu have been playing the needed supportive roles to the governor. Therefore, for this good work to continue, I urge you all to support our governor, speaker and Ogundimu for another term in office,” Ologunde said. This was re-echoed by Mrs. Tinubu-Ojo who was represented by Toyin Kudus. The communiqué confirming the endorsement for the trio signed by prominent people in Agege was later read by Rotimi Adeshina, former chairman of the local government who was also member of the House of Assembly. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
