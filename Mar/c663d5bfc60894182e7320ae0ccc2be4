Provisional data indicated that cumulative foreign exchange inflow into the economy amounted to $33.77 billion in the first half of 2017, signifying an increase of 0.6 and 16.4 per cent above the levels in the second half of 2016 and the corresponding period of 2016, respectively. Significantly, six of the largest banks in the country accounted for 60.11 per cent of total industry assets, as against the 53.68 per cent recorded at end-December 2016. These were contained in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Financial Stability Report as at the end of June 2017, posted on its website. The increase in the inflow was largely due to the 29.2 per cent rise in inflow through the CBN, compared with the level in the second half of 2016. Receipts through the CBN and autonomous sources accounted for 47.2 per cent and 52.8 per cent of total inflow into the economy, respectively. Total foreign exchange outflow from the economy in the first half of 2017 was $13.75 billion, indicating 0.5 per cent increase above the level in the second half of 2016. The rise in outflow was mainly attributed to increased interbank sales. Consequently, a net foreign exchange inflow of $20.01 billion was recorded into the economy during the review period, compared with a net inflow of $19.9 billion and $17.12 billion in the second half of 2016 and the corresponding period of 2016, respectively. The total autonomous inflow fell by16.0 per cent to $17.83 billion, compared to the level in the second half of 2016 due to decline in invisibles purchases by 17.4 per cent, of which 56.6 per cent was accounted for by domiciliary account balances. Foreign exchange inflows through the CBN amounted to $15.93 billion in the first half of 2017, an increase of 29.2 and 87.6 per cent above the levels in the preceding and the corresponding periods of 2016, respectively. This improvement was due to the growth in non-oil related receipts which rose by 72.11 per cent to $11.65 billion. Oil related receipt was $4.28 billion, representing a decrease of 23.11 per cent relative to the level in the second half of 2016. Foreign exchange outflow through the CBN rose by 2.7 per cent to $12.76billion, above the level in the second half of 2016. Interbank utilisation accounted for $9.84 billion, of which interbank forwards, interbank sales and others represented 45.0, 40.8and 14.2 per cent, respectively. Total foreign exchange transactions through the CBN resulted in a net inflow of $3.18 billion in the first half of 2017, compared with the net outflow of $0.88 billion and $2.26 billion in December and June 2016. Meanwhile, the 60.11 per cent total industry assets contributed by the six banks, according to the report, highlighted the oligopolistic market structure of the banking industry, with few banks controlling more than 50 per cent of the industry deposits and assets. Furthermore, it stated that the low concentration ratios in the industry showed a trend towards more competition across the banks. “The market share of the largest bank with respect to deposits and assets stood at 12.93 and 14.79 per cent, respectively, while that of the second largest bank stood at 12.88 and 11.72 per cent. “Twenty-three other banks had market shares ranging from 0.02 to 9.01 per cent in deposits and 0.08 to 9.96 per cent in assets. “The increased competition in the banking industry was supported by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)5 for the industry, which stood at 737.66 and 783.65 for deposits and assets, respectively, at end-June 2017 compared with 773.21 and 774.50 for deposits and assets at end-December 2016,” the report stated. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
