Lagos – Chief Sunny Onuesoke, a former governorship aspirant of the  Peoples  Democratic  Party (PDP) in  Delta state on Monday denied nursing any governorship ambition in the state come 2019. In a statement by his media aide, Stanley Efe, Onuesoke, who is the National Director, Media and Publicity of Atiku Care Foundation said he is committed towards ensuring that  Governor Ifeanyi  Okowa of Delta state is reelected for a second term. The statement reads “Onuesoke does not have any Governorship ambition for 2019. He has not told anyone if he will be contesting Governorship or any other elective position come 2019. He’s a firm believer and crusader for Gov. Okowa’s second term in office.” “Gov. Okowa has done much for the good people of Delta State and as such deserves the support of all to ensure continuity with the SMART and Prosperity agenda of His Excellency” “So Okowa’s re-election is Onuesoke’s major concern. He’s not contesting Governorship come 2019. If he is  interested in any other elective position, we will surely get such information across to you people, the press” he stated. Also speaking on his recent meeting with Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, former vice- president and PDP chieftain, the statement said it has to do with plans, preparations and strategies for the forthcoming general elections. It said details of the meeting will be made available to newsmen soon. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
