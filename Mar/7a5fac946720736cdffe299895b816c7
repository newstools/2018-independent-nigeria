The Zimbabwe Gender Commission has expressed concern over political violence targeting women ahead of general elections to be held between July and August. Deputy president of the country’s biggest opposition party the MDC-T, Thokozani Khupe, has been attacked twice recently by members of her own party following her rejection of co-vice president Nelson Chamisa as the party’s interim leader until congress in 2019. In a statement Thursday, the commission said it was deeply concerned about reported attacks against female political leaders. “These attacks are worrisome particularly with the looming general elections, as they will inevitably escalate to outbreaks of political violence during and after the elections, if left unchecked,” the commission said. The commission added that such practices exacerbated the disparity between men and women in politics and decision-making positions and worked against gender equality and peaceful, free, fair and credible elections. Khupe was also attacked in August 2017 by fellow party members for allegedly holding an unsanctioned meeting at the party’s offices in the second city of Bulawayo. The commission called on political leaders to take a strong stance against electoral and political violence against women and improve their status within their political parties. Various civic organisations have also expressed concern over the recent acts of violence against Khupe. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
