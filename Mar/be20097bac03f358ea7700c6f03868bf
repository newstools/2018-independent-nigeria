Abuja – Daid Jurji, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Chief of Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), has declared that globally, 88% of diarrhea was caused by contaminated water and unhygienic practices. Jurji made the declaration in his presentation entitled, “Moving Sanitation Forward in Nigeria” at a two-day workshop on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene. He said diarrhea was the second leading causes of death in children as about 1.9 million children under the age of 5 years, mostly in developing countries, die from diarrhea globally. He however opined that, “an investment of 1 dollar into WASH projects (such as provision of safe water, sanitation and hygiene) would bring back 25 dollars in good health. He stressed that Nigeria consistently increased the numbers of people practising open defecation as about 25 percent still practise it. Jurji said that for water to be used, it has to travel from source to household and in the process, “when people openly defecate, they go straight to pollute the water sources, children playing with sand will mistakenly put it in their mouth; when a mother changes her baby diapers and she fails to watch her hands with soap and water, she also carries the bacteria,” he stated. He stated that less than 10 percent of Nigerians have access to suitable water for drinking and 90 per cent drinks water that is contaminated with faeces and E. coli (Escherichia coli). 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
