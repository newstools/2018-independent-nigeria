The European Union will stand by Britain after London said it was likely that Moscow was behind a nerve toxin attack on a former Russian double agent in England, a senior EU official said on Tuesday. “We are very much concerned with the situation, also the findings the UK has so far,” European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters when asked if the EU might back action against Russia over the case. “Of course the UK can count on EU solidarity in this regard,” he added. Dombrovskis, a former prime minister of ex-Soviet Latvia, did not elaborate. As the commissioner in charge of the euro, he was arriving for a meeting of EU finance ministers. On Monday, the deputy head of the Commission, Frans Timmermans, told the European Parliament that the EU would show solidarity with Britain, which is leaving the Union next year but has pledged to continue close security and diplomatic ties. Following Monday’s accusation by Prime Minister Theresa May that Moscow was“highly likely” to have been behind the attempt to kill Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, Timmermans tweeted:“I followed closely the declaration made by PM May today on the attack with nerve gas in the UK. “I want to express my strong feelings of solidarity with the British people and the British government. We stand with you. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
