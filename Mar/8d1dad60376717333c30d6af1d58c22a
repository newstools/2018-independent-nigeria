Lagos – The North African jinx against Nigerian football clubs in the CAF Champions League continued over the weekend after both Plateau United and Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) Football Clubs were booted out of the competition. On Sunday Plateau United could only manage a slim 1-0 win over Etoile du Sahel of Tunisia at the Sani Abacha Stadium in Kano, thereby losing 4-3 aggregate after the first leg in Sousse ended 4-2 in their disfavor. Recall that on Saturday, MC Algers eliminated MFM with a whooping 7-2 aggregate score when they trounced the Nigerians 6-0 in Algiers having earlier lost 1-2 in Lagos penultimate Wednesday. Both MFM and Plateau United now drop down to the CAF Confederation Cup last qualifying round before its own mini league stage. The last time a Nigerian club won the foremost club trophy in Africa was in 2004 when Enyimba of Aba successfully defended the title, which they earlier won in 2003. Before then, the trophy had remained elusive to the country. Meanwhile, the last time a Nigerian club made it to the group stage was in 2016 and it was the same Enyimba. They were pooled alongside Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa, Zamalek of Egypt and ES Setif of Algeria in Group B. 0 comments
