Osogbo – A socio-political group, Movement For New Nigeria (MNN) has bemoaned the Senator representing Osun West Senatorial District, Senator Ademola Nurudeen Adeleke over incessant display of dancing skill wherever he goes. The group in a statement made available to newsmen by its National Coordinator, Sunday Kelani, noted that the senator has taken it as a tradition to dance at any event he attends instead of contributing meaningfully to national issues as a lawmaker of Federal Republic of Nigeria. It chided him for “taking the dignity of legislature for granted” adding that he is no more a private person, but a public office holder in Nigeria. “The routine dance of the Senator representing Osun West senatorial district is becoming a big embarrassment for people of his constituency and Nigerians as a whole. “Instead of making appreciable contribution constructively to nation-building, Senator Adekeke is busy dancing across the country rather unabatedly. “The place of legislature in a democracy is too important and serious for any of its member to resort to a mere entertainer and official dancer. “This attitude of the lawmaker is highly unbecoming of a man with that political stature; this must stop as a matter of importance and exigency. “There is a limit to how a politician could go to impress the people  outside the specified statutory obligation through performance; the earlier the senator knows that his dancing step is no more catching the fancy of anyone the better for him, “ the statement said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
