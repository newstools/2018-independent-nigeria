Former Chelsea midfielder Ray Wilkins has suffered a heart attack and is in hospital. The cardiac arrest happened at his Cobham home, and was preceded by a fall that has resulted in Ray being put in an induced coma. His wife Jackie speaking with the Daily Mirror had this to say: “He’s in hospital, he`s had a cardiac arrest and is in intensive care. He is not in a good state at all, I`m afraid. He`s critically ill. The cardiac arrest led to a fall which has meant he’s had to be put in an induced coma. It’s very, very bad.” The footballing world rushed to send well-wishes to former England captain Ray Wilkins following news of his cardiac arrest. The 61-year-old, best known for his time as a player and then coach at Chelsea, is in an induced coma at St George’s Hospital. Wilkins also played for the likes of Manchester United, Rangers, QPR, Crystal Palace, Millwall and Leyton Orient as well as spells in mainland Europe with AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. He made 84 appearances for England, named captain on 10 occasions, during a playing career spanning over three decades.   Mr. Wilkins spent six seasons as part of Chelsea’s backroom staff, over two spells, under Gianluca Vialli, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Guus Hiddink and Carlo Ancelotti either as coach or assistant manager. Frank Lampard said all his “thoughts and strength” were with Wilkins, describing him as an “absolute Gentleman” in an Instagram post. Didier Drogba added on the same social media site: “Just found out about the news, be strong Ray Wilkins and family. We blue army are sending you our prayers on this religious day.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
