The outgoing state commissioner of police, Ali Janga, confirmed the development on Friday. He, however, did not disclose the names of the arrested suspects. “Yes, it is confirmed, but note that I am no longer the CP, I have been removed, so next time talk to the new CP, ” Punch quoted him as saying. According to him, the suspects were re-arrested earlier on Friday. Janga also did not disclose the location they were nabbed. Two of the suspects reportedly sustained gun shot wounds when they attempted to flee from the police. They were said to be receiving treatment at the Federal Medical Centre, Lokoja, as of the time of filling this report. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
