A 26-year-old woman recently sold her virginity for R17m. Simply known as “Jasmin”, the London based student turned to an escort company and has now found a “Hollywood actor” who was willing to hand out €1.2m for the privilege. Jasmin spoke to the Daily Mail about why she isn’t a fan of the general view on virginity. Jasmin turned to Cinderella Escorts, believe it or not, a company that has experience with helping young women sell their virginity for millions. The brunette then shortened her final list to three men and sat and had dinner with each of them before making her final pick. A businessman from Munich was turned down for being too old and a Manchester United fan. Instead, she ended up with a supposedly “well-known” Hollywood actor. So is the whole procedure safe for Jasmin and people like her? Jan Zakobielski, the German man who runs the company, told News.com.au that the women are accompanied to meeting and officials are in the vicinity if “problems arise”. The women also have to “show us a medical certificate that proves they are real virgins”. Some prior candidates have been rejected by the agency if Zakobielski believed they were being forced by someone else. The final “transaction” normally takes place in Germany, where such a deal is legal. As long as everyone involved is truly happy with what they’re doing, then can you really fault them? 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
