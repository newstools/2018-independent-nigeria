The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has offered Hertha Berlin centre-back, Jordan Torunarigha, in the Super Eagles’ 23-man to the summer World Cup in Russia. This will give the Germany U-21 international to represent the same country as his father. The Bundesliga player could switch allegiances and play for the Super Eagles, which his father, Ojokojo Torunarigha, won 12 caps for in the 1990s. Eligible to play for Nigeria and Germany, the NFF has now offered the centre-back a ticket to the World Cup, his agent, Thomas Zorn, confirmed to B.Z. “That’s true. We have such a request from the NFF,” Zorn said, and the paper added that Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr has tried for several months now to win over the centre-back. “Jordan must listen to his heart,” Zorn said. “This request is a huge honour, and also a confirmation for his great development. But I think his journey for the German FA is not over.” Hertha coach Pal Dardai, 42, said that while “the World Cup is a huge chance for him, it might be better for his development if he first plays for Germany’s U-21.” “Maybe, he can even play for Germany one day,” he said. Coming through the ranks of Hertha’s academy, Torunarigha has played for Germany’s youth teams since late 2014, and since debuting for Berlin’s pro team in February 2017 has made 21 appearances for the club in Bundesliga and Europa League competition. Torunarigha has been selected for Germany’s upcoming U-21 European Championship qualifiers against Israel and Kosovo. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
