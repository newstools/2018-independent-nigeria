A 23-year-old man, Emmanuel Udeneze, on Friday  appeared before an Abeokuta Magistrates’ Court for allegedly inflicting injuries on his neighbour over N500 debt. Udeneze, who resides on Ayetoro Road, Lafenwa in Abeokuta, is facing a count charge of assault. The prosecutor, Police Inspector Olakunle Shonibare, told the court that the accused committed the offence in January, 2018 at his residence. Shonibare said that the accused used a cutlass and long spoon to inflict injuries on the forehead of his neighbor, Mr Sunday Onukogu. He said trouble started when the accused took a keg of  petrol kept by Onukogu at their corridor in exchange for N500 he claimed the complainant borrowed from him. “The complainant asked the accused to produce the keg of petrol, and that led to a fight. “Before neighbours could intervene, the accused had used the cutlets on the complainant,” he said. Shonibare said the offence contravened Section 355 of the Criminal Law of Ogun, 2006. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Magistrate, Mr Idowu Olayinka, granted him bail in the sum of N50,000 with one surety in like sum, and adjourned the case until March 16, 2018.0 for mention. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
