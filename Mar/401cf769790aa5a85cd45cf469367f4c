Ikechukwu Ezenwa, one of the three Super Eagles goalkeepers, believes that the team should win their first two group games before playing Argentina at the summer World Cup in Russia. Nigeria drawn in group D with Croatia, Iceland and Argentina will kick off their campaign against Croatia on June 16 before playing Iceland on June 22 and Argentina on June 26. Ezenwa in an interview with goal.com said that playing Argentina last was a blessing in disguise, saying, “Yes of course [it is a blessing in disguise]. But the most important thing still remains winning our first two games against Croatia and Iceland to qualify before playing Argentina. “We’re looking to go forward as far as the semi-final, final and I think that is every player’s dream. When you go to a competition, you have the ambition of ‘I want to lift this trophy’ and that’s the zeal we are going there with, and I think with God all things are possible,” he concluded. He said that the friendly games against Poland on Friday and Serbia on Monday would help build ‘more confidence’ in the team ahead of World Cup. “I think it’s a good one because it is a game that would bring more confidence to the team – playing two international friendly games before the World Cup – not only the two, we are playing five,” Ezenwa told Goal. “It’s a signal that gives the team understanding and belief that we can do it because we are playing World Cup-bound teams. “I’m fit now and I’m focused. World Cup is around the corner, everybody has to keep in shape and get set,” he added. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
