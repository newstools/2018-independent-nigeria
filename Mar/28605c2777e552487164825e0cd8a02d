Super Eagles manager,  Gernot Rohr, belsaid he felt the absence of Captain Mikel Obi in Friday’s friendly game against Poland. Despite winning the friendly 1-0, Rohr said that his absence was felt in the game. For the first time in their Super Eagles careers, Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi and Torino’s Joel Obi lined up together in midfield. Rohr thinks they did not pull their weight and rued the absence of his captain, John Obi Mikel. Joel Obi started ahead of Eddy Onazi, and the coach explained they wanted to see how he adapts to the team. ”We won without our captain, John Obi Mikel, which happened to us for the first time. We showed that we are not a team of one player,” Rohr told reporters post-match. ”Such matches like this create new leaders; they also make us better as a team. However, the lack of Mikel was visible; we had a lot of problems in the middle of the field. ”On the other hand, I am happy that we have managed without him, I must emphasize that I am waiting for him in the next games. At the World Cup he will be necessary for us.” In his first appearance for the Super Eagles for close to four years, Joel Obi was replaced by Onazi in the 65th minute while Ndidi went the full ninety. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
