Though they did not make much impact in the just concluded Winter Olympics, the Nigerian Bobsled team did make history. That is why it was befitting when they were treated to a rousing welcome at the Muritala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA), Ikeja Lagos. The Nigerian team to Pyeonchang, South Korea was led by Bobsled Driver, Seun Adigun comprising Ngozi Onwumere, Akuoma Omeoga and Simi Adeagbo. They were treated to a heroâ€™s welcome at the airport by a reception party put together by the Temple Management Company (TMC), the marketing agency of the Bobsled & Skeleton Federation of Nigeria (BSFN). Among dignitaries that came to receive them were TMC talents including Bisola Aiyeola, Tee-Y Mix and Jeff Akoh. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
