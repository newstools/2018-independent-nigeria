Jose Mourinho is considering a bid for Neymar worth a world-record £260 million, possibly sending Paul Pogba to PSG as part of the deal, Diario Gol claims. With Neymar apparently unsettled at Parc des Princes, the Manchester United manager is keen to add a world-class striker to his ranks after seeing Alexis Sanchez flounder. And while Real Madrid have been linked most closely with the Brazilian, United are interested too – and could send unsettled Pogba the other way to tempt PSG into a sale. Neymar, meanwhile, could be offered up to £30m a year to move to Old Trafford. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
