Controversial social critic and singer, Pascal Uche Ejikeme, popularly known as Etcetera is finally back on the music scene after eight years of silence. Etcetera, Nigerian-born singer, songwriter, and social activist whose passion for the common man shines through his lush melodies and haunting images, took his passion for social justice from Nigeria to America. The singer is making the grand comeback with the single just released in the United States, ‘No virgin In America’. As funny as the name sounds, the song does convey a message. The song, he says, talks about the hypocrisy of the American system. “It’s a song about how America preaches good rules from one side of her mouth and encourages and extols promiscuity from the other. How the American currency with ‘In God we Trust’ written boldly is being used to spread chaos in different parts of the world.” He continued, “Living in the United States for just over two years has opened my eyes to the hypocrite that the United States is,” he said is a private chat with Saturday INDEPENDENT. It is alleged that the alternative music act, left Nigeria as a result of the constant death threats he was receiving for his barrage of criticisms of the president and the ruling party during the run-off to the 2015 presidential election as a columnist for Punch newspaper. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
