The EU will consider Northern Ireland as part of the EU customs union unless another solution is found to avoid a hard border on Ireland, according to a draft text of Britain’s withdrawal deal unveiled on Wednesday. The 120-page document is the EU’s first stab at translating the political agreement reached in December on the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU into a legal text that will be part of Britain’s withdrawal treaty. The draft says that EU customs legislation “shall apply to and in the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland.’’ It said “the territory of Northern Ireland shall be considered to be part of the customs territory of the Union.’’ According to the text, the above protocol can be ignored if a subsequent agreement is found to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In the political agreement reached in December, the EU and Britain said the option to essentially keep Northern Ireland in the customs union could be avoided through either a future trade deal or a solution specifically recommended by Britain. EU Chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said that the backstop option, which would ensure regulatory alignment between the EU and Northern Ireland, was included “as a precaution.’’ Britain has so far rejected the idea of keeping Northern Ireland in the EU customs union because it would require a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
