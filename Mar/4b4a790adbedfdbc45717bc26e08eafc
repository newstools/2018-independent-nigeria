Lagos – From $5.516 billion in 2016 to $7.329 billion in 2017, portfolio investment in Nigeria pushed the country’s total capital importation to $12.228 billion in 2017, representing 60 percent increase of capital imported. The Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) disclosed this on Thursday in its Q4 2017 and full year 2017 capital importation report. The total capital imported in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.382 billion. This was an annual growth of 247.5 percent, and quarterly growth of 29.9 percent. As at the end of 2017, total capital imported into Nigeria was $12.228 billion, an increase of $7.104 billion or 138.7 percent from the figure recorded in 2016. Portfolio Investment, which recorded $3.477.5 million in fourth quarter of 2017, remained the largest component of capital imported and contributed 64.6 percent of the total amount ($5.382 billion). It increased significantly year on year, recording a rise of 1,123.5 percent or $3.193 billion (from $284.2 million to $3.477 billion), expanding faster than the two other components of capital importation. Foreign Direct Investment recorded $378.4 million in Q4, which is a year on year increase of 9.8 percent, while Other Investment recorded $1.526 billion, growing by 66 percent when compared to Q4 of 2016. In Q4 2017, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) hit $378.4 million for the first time since Q4 2015 when it reported $123.2 million. This figure in Q4 2017 was a substantial increase of 221.8 percent when compared to the Q3, and a 9.8 percent increase compared to Q4 2017. The growth in FDI was mainly driven by Equity Investments, which contributed 99.8 percent, while Other Capital Investment contributed 0.2 percent. Portfolio Investment was the main driver of Capital Importation in the fourth quarter of 2017, with an amount of $3,477 billion, representing a quarter on quarter growth of 25.7 percent. Year on year, it increased by 1,123.5 percent, which is over twelve times the figure recorded in Q4 2016 ($284.2 million). The increase in Portfolio Investment was driven by a strong growth in Money Market Instruments, which recorded $2.178 billion, the first time since Q3 2013. Money Market Instruments contributed 63 percent to Portfolio investments. Equity, which had been the main driver of portfolio investments in previous quarters, dropped by $942.9 million from $1.932 billion in Q3 2017 to $989.2 million in Q4 2017. On the other hand, bonds recorded an increase of $194.1 million, from $115.4 million in Q3 to $309.5 million in Q4 of the same year. Other Investment accounted for 28.4% of total capital importation in the fourth quarter of 2017. This category of capital importation grew 65.96% year on year, and by 21.2% when compared to the previous quarter. The $1.526 billion recorded by Other Investment was mainly in the form of loans, which was $1.091 billion in the fourth quarter, followed by Other Claims which recorded $425.7 million, and then Trade credits which reported $10 million, having posted no inflows since Q4 2016. According to the figures for the 4th quarter of 2017, Abuja attracted the highest amount of foreign capital, accounting for $2.680 billion or 49.8 percent. This was an increase of 227.8 percent from the figure recorded in the third quarter of 2017 ($817.6 million). Lagos, which has always had the highest share of capital importation, had its share drop from 79.5 percent of total share in Q3 2017, to a share of 47.4 percent in Q4, 2017. Other states, including Akwa Ibom, Ogun, Oyo, and Delta also attracted foreign capital investments. However, the country from which Nigeria imported the most capital from was the United Kingdom, which accounted for $1.609 billion, or 30 percent of the total of capital inflow in Q4, 2017. This value was a decline of 7.3 percent relative to the figure in the previous quarter, and a 233.4 percent growth over the corresponding period of last year. Commenting on the report, Cyril Amkpa, an Abuja-based economist, said the increase in capital importation in 2017 showed how Nigeria was able to exit recession in the year. “I think this is one of the reasons why Nigeria was able to exit recession in a record time as the impact of capital importation was significant in this regard. “Another significant aspect of this report was the fact that Abuja upstaged Lagos in states with the highest capital importation for Q4 2017.” 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
