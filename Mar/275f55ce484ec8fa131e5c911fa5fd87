Tiger Woods and Ernie Els shifted their decades-long friendly rivalry onto the international stage as they were officially named captains for the 2019 Presidents Cup on Tuesday. Woods, who holds the matchplay competition’s record with 24 match wins for the U.S., and Els, who has won an International side best 20 matches, will lead their teams to Australia. Australia will host the 2019 edition of the Cup from Dec. 12 to Dec. 15 at Royal Melbourne. The announcement was made in the Latrobe Room at Bay Hill, site of this week’s Arnold Palmer Invitational on the PGA Tour. Els and Woods have frequently shared golf’s main stage. Four-times major winner Els of South Africa has been runner-up to Woods seven times in his professional playing career, including twice in majors — the U.S. and British Open in 2000. Woods and Els served as captain’s assistants in the 2017 Presidents Cup. Then, the 12-man U.S. team won 19-11 at Liberty National in New Jersey for their 10th Cup victory against one loss and one draw in the biennial event. Els and Woods also shared an iconic moment at the 2003 Presidents Cup when they faced off in a sudden-death playoff to decide the competition. They battled evenly through three tension-packed playoff holes before failing light forced officials to declare the event in South Africa a draw. “Tiger and I have had some great duels in the past, and I look forward to the challenge of going against my longtime friend yet again in 2019,” said Els. Els might even have to stomach Woods once again wielding a golf club in the matchplay competition. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
