Ola said Arik Air had reported both incidents to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) in line with standard operating procedure and the airline’s high safety standards. “The first incident involved a Boeing 737-700 marked 5N-MJJ, which was bumped into by the Skyway Aviation Handling Company (SAHCOL) step on the ramp at MMA2. “The aircraft, which was scheduled to operate W3 744 (Lagos-Port Harcourt), had its left side leading edge of horizontal stabiliser damaged. “Another aircraft was provided immediately for the Port-Harcourt bound passengers.
