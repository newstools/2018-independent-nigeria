Russia’s Olympic membership has been restored by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) following its suspension from Pyeongchang 2018. Russia was banned from February’s Games by the IOC over state-sponsored doping. Before Sunday’s closing ceremony in South Korea, the IOC had said the ban would be lifted, so long as there were no more anti-doping violations. All the remaining tests on the Olympic Athlete from Russia (OAR) team came back negative, the IOC said. “The suspension of the Russian Olympic Committee is automatically lifted with immediate effect,” the IOC said in a statement. ROC president Alexander Zhukov welcomed the IOC’s “important” decision. “The Russian Olympic Committee has had its rights fully restored,” he said on state TV on Wednesday. A total of 168 Russians competed as part of a neutral OAR team at the Winter Olympics, but two failed drugs tests. They had all been required to prove they were clean before the Games. The OAR team was the third largest and won 17 medals, including two golds. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
