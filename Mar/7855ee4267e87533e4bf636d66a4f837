President Vladimir Putin of Russia has no concerns about being portrayed as the world’s main villain by some, stressing that such perceptions are only shared by certain groups in Western countries. The interview-based documentary “World Order 2018” revealed on Wednesday. “Ask villains, this is the opinion of Western sources, and not even of all of them, I got used to it long ago. There are very good guidelines, very good beacons. “This beacon is the interests of the Russian Federation and its people. If I feel that I have not turned away and I am on the right path, I do not care about anything else. “It just does not distract me from the tasks I consider paramount for our country,” he stated when asked to comment on him being labelled the world’s “main villain” in the West. Putin denied that the label of “main villain” and consistently negative media campaigns had caused him any emotional distress. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
