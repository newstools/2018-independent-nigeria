German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, said that the “fight for equal rights for women continues” in spite the progress made so far, in an Instagram post for International Women’s Day. In a video message on Thursday, Merkel said: “many women before us made sacrifices and fought doggedly for women to have more rights. “It is now 100 years since women themselves could vote. “But we are of course not happy just to vote, we also want to shape policies in all areas: to take on political responsibility in the family, in the world of work.” Merkel also hinted at greater female representation in her new government. She is set to be re-elected for a fourth term as German chancellor next week after her conservative bloc hammered out a hard-won coalition deal with the Social Democrats (SPD) almost six months after an inconclusive election result. “I am permitted also to say today that the new cabinet will definitely be an interesting mix of men and women,” Merkel said. She went on to say there was still much to do in Germany to achieve full equality between men and women, but even more in countries where women lack even basic rights. “Today is not just a day to look back on what we have achieved, but also a day on which we say: The fight for equal rights for women continues,” she concluded. At a G20 women’s summit in April 2017, Merkel refused to answer a question about whether or not she was a feminist, saying that she felt uncomfortable taking credit for activists’ successes. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
