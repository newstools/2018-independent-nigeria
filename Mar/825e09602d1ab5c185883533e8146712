The Honourable Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, has advised tax payers to demand for written notice when they receive phone calls from tax officials. Adeosun, in response to the activities of some fake tax officials alleging to be officials of the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS), gave this advice in Abuja yesterday “My attention has been drawn to reports of some unidentified tax officials requesting for bank details and address of tax payers. “If you receive a phone call from someone claiming to be from the Tax Office, do not panic. Ask them to send you a written notice. Do not provide any details like your address or bank details,” she said. It would be recalled that, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai , the Executive Governor of Kaduna State, and Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, the Minister of Finance, honoured a consistent tax payer, Elder Lema Jibrin recently. Jibrin was honoured during the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS) Sensitisation programme in Kaduna last Thursday. The Kaduna State Governor noted that Jibrin had consistently paid tax to the government for 40 years. “Elder Lema Jibrin, the Dan Iyan Katsina, is the most tax compliant Nigerian. He has been paying his taxes consistently for 40 years and has not relented or evaded the payment of taxes,” el-Rufai said. Adeosun, however, commended Elder Jibrin for his consistency and diligence in tax payment, and urged tax payers to utilise the amnesty programme of the Federal Government to regularise their tax profiles. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
