The Igala Vanguard, a socio-cultural group has urged Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and Sen. Dino Melaye (Kogi-APC) to put to an end their rift, describing their crisis as an embarrassment to the state. Mr Lawrence Akpa, the group’s convener, in a statement on Saturday, urged the two leaders to put aside their differences and concentrate on good governance, which they promised the electorate in their party manifesto. They urged Bello and Melaye to work in synergy with other elected officials for the development of the state and bequeath a legacy to the coming generations. The group also canvassed support for the victims of attacks being carried out by suspected herdsman in Kogi, lamenting that the survivors had been left without camps or relief materials to ease their plight. It also urged Bello to immortalise the late Prince Abubakar Audu, ex-governor of the state, for his contributions to the state’s development, saying he worked and died for the people of Kogi State. It would be recalled that Price Audu died while the votes for  the 2015 governorship election of which he was leading, were being announced, leading to the emergence of Bello as the substituted candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who became the governor. The group stated that the late Audu was a pride to the Igala Kingdom and a strong promoter of a united and progressive Kogi, even as he contributed immensely to the growth and development of the APC and democracy in the state. He said the APC’s victory in the 2015 governorship poll in the state was a reflection of the people’s confidence in late Audu’s leadership style. 6 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
