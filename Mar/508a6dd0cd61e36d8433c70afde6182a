Ibadan – Comrade Rotimi Olumo, Oyo State Coordinator of the Gani Adams-led Oodua People’s Congress (OPC), has urged security agencies in the state to ignore false alarm always raised by the New Era faction of the Yoruba socio-cultural group. Olumo stated this while speaking with newsmen during this year’s edition of Oke Ibadan Festival. He lamented that it was unfortunate that the New Era OPC could allege that Aare Gani Adams led OPC wanted to destabilise the ancient city of Ibadan during the prestigious traditional festival of Ibadan people. He said Otunba Gani Adams, the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, had been supporting and participating in the Oke Ibadan festival for many years without any problem. Comrade Olumo revealed that Aare Ona Kakanfo gave OPC both the moral and financial support because he believed that it is not only Ibadan indigenes that should celebrate the festival. He declared as untrue the rumour peddled by some people that OPC/Gani Adams wanted to use the festival to cause crisis in Ibadan. He said, “You can see that we are very decent and organised and that is why we all gather here to celebrate this glorious occasion. What the Aare Gani Adams led OPC is after is to promote peace and unity in Oyo State.” He used the opportunity to urge all sons and daughters of Ibadan land both at home and abroad to support the celebration of Oke Ibadan Festival because of its significance in the history of Ibadan land. Olumo also congratulated the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, on the occasion of this year’s edition of the festival. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
