Lagos – The U-20 Women’s team, the Falconets, have been drawn in Group D of the 9th FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup alongside Germany, Haiti and China. The tournament billed for Aug. 5 to Aug. 24 will hold in four cities of France namely: Vannes, Concarneau, Dinan-Lehon and Saint-Malo from August 5 to 24. Falconets will kick off their campaign against three-time champions, Germany on August 6 at the Stade Marville Stadium, Saint-Malo before playing  Haiti on August 9 at the same venue and China on August 13 at Stade du Clos Gastel, Dinan-Léhon. It will be recalled that Germany won two of their titles with victories over Nigeria in 2010 and 2014 editions of the World Cup. In Group A are hosts, France, Ghana, New Zealand and Netherlands, while Korea Democratic Peoples Republic (DPR), England, Mexico and Brazil would slug it out in Group B and Group C has USA, Japan, Paraguay and Spain. France will play the opening match of the World Cup on August 5 against Ghana at Stade de la Rabine, Vannes. But Christopher Danjuma, Falconets’ coach has described the draw as fair, describing their group opponents as strong but surmountable. “We will prepare our team to be mentally ready,’’ he said. “The group is fair. For any team to qualify to this stage means that they are a strong side. “But what we need at this level of the World Cup is for the players to be mentally tough and not allow fear no matter who the opponents are. “We will work as hard as possible because the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) is doing all it can to ensure that we have quality preparations,’’ Danjuma said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
