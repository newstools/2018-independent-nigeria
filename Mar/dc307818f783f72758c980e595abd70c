President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday met behind closed doors with former Vice President Namadi Sambo at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The meeting, which took place in the president’s office, lasted for less than an hour. Sambo, however, declined comment on the outcome of his meeting, saying it was a private visit. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had on February 2, 2016, raided an office complex in Abuja belonging to Sambo. EFCC operatives carried out the raid in search of clues linking him to the $2.1 billion arms scandal popularly referred to as Dasukigate. Sambo served as Nigeria’s vice president Goodluck Jonathan between May 19, 2010 and May 29, 2015. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
