Qatar would spend 4 billion dollars on developing Sudan’s Red Sea port, Sudan’s Information Minister said on Tuesday. Qatari officials pledged the funds on a weekend visit, under an agreement whereby the east African nation will own 51 per cent of the project and the Gulf country the remainder. The government of Qatar plans to rebuild the old port, information minister, Ahmed Mohammed Osman told dpa on phone from the capital, Khartoum. The project, which is in a strategic position between Africa and the Middle East, is expected to be completed by 2020. The redevelopment of Suakin Port is the beginning of a new chapter in the countries’ bilateral relations, with Sudan a longtime ally of Qatar’s rival Saudi Arabia. It could also rattle neighbouring Egypt, another Qatari rival. Egypt has already expressed unease over Sudan’s rapprochement with its other rival, Turkey. Sudan has denied reports in Egyptian media that Turkey would set up an airbase on Suakin island. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
