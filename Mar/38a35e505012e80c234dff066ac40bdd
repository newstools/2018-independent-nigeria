Lagos – President Mohammadu Buhari will today host CHAN Eagles that placed second in the just concluded African Nations Championship (CHAN) in Morocco in Aso Rock. President Buhari would have hosted the players shortly after returning from Morocco, but state exigencies necessitated the postponement. The team reached the final of CHAN for the first time but lost 4-0 to host Morocco in the final. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that the presidency had remained mute on any possible financial reward for the team. “When you talk of money, I am not aware of that and can’t talk on that, but there may be or there may not be any monetary reward for the team; remember that they did not win the tournament, but the president was impressed with their performance,” a source revealed to the newspaper. Nigeria reached the last four of the CHAN in South Africa four years ago, but they failed to go past the group stage in Rwanda in 2016. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
