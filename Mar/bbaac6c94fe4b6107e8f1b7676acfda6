Still on the Senate and Dino Melaye, the man has shown that he does not lose his sense of humour and his Baba Sala ways, even in the face of adversity. In fact he tends to pump up the volume.
After allegations of aiding criminals were levelled against him this week, the Frank Spencer wannabe went straight to social media and gave a stellar performance. In an over one minute rant, the senator makes mockery of the allegations while making funny gestures at the camera.
It would not be a Melaye classic without an Ajeku Iya outro, which he pulled off flawlessly. He insinuated that the governor of Kogi, Yahaya Bello is behind his travails and he will not go unpunished. In fact, Melaye went as far as promising Bello that he will end up in jail after all is said and done.
