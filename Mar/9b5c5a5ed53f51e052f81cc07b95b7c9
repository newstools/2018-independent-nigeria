Benin – The Benin monarch, Oba Ewuare II, at the weekend placed curses on those aiding and abetting human trafficking as well as those initiating the sons and daughters of the land into various cult groups. Also cursed are people who violate the order banning Community Development Associations in Benin Kingdom and the native doctors who subject victims of human trafficking to oath of secrecy. Those joined the monarch in the excercise were the Ohen Okhuae, Ohen Ovia, Ohen noriyekeogba, Ohen Ake, Ohen Niwuo, Native Doctors, Ohen Sango,  Odionwere, Iwueki and the  Enigie. Oba Ewuare said those aiding and abetting human trafficking through the use of black magic and subjecting them to the oath of secrecies should desist from it henceforth or face the wrath of the gods. According to him, “You native doctors whose business are to subject people to the oath of secrecies and encouraging this evil act on the land, you have to repent, stop doing it. This is not a joking matter and if you do not repent, you have to wait for the repercussion.” The monarch emphasised that the palace was not against serious native doctors, but frowns at those who perpetrate evil in the land through it, and aiding and abetting human trafficking in the state. 3 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
