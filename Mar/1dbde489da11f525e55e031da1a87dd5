Lagos – The Foundation for Human Rights and Anti-corruption Crusaders (FOHURAC), a human rights group, has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari not to withhold assent to the National Maritime University (NMU) Bill which has been passed by the National Assembly. Barrister Alaowei Cleric, FOHURAC National President, in a statement made available to Sunday INDEPENDENT on Saturday, said that failure to give assent to the bill could ignite a conflagration in the volatile region, thereby putting the lives and property at risk. The rights group, which was responding to a call by Alhpa May Club (AMC), a Lagos based Itsekiri social Club on the president not to give assent to the bill, maintained that listening to advice of the group would amount to chaos and invitation to anarchy and bloodbath in the Niger Delta. He urged those planning to stop President Buhari from giving assent to the bill and working against the existence of the National Maritime University (NMU) to give peace a chance in the Niger Delta. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
