Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori, the Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly, and Chief Hon. Julius Jessa Scott, the chairman of Okpe Local Government Area have urged the newly inaugurated  members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Grassroots Support Foundation (GSF) to be more involved in the party’s membership drive. This, they stressed, would make Senator Ifeanyi Okowa’s re-election bid possible, come 2019, saying that the governor had performed marvelously and deserves a second term. Oborevwori, who spoke at the swearing-in of the GSF executives in Orerokpe, headquarter of Okpe LGA, urged the new group to be serious, especially in area of membership drive. The Speaker, who was represented by Hon. Okan Oyovwikigho, his Chief of Staff and Barrister Leader Eju, Secretary to the Okpe LGA, who stood in for the Chairman of the Council, tasked the group to ensure that defectors from other parties were attracted to PDP for the party to move forward. The leaders, who described the formation of the group as a welcome development, stressed the need for increased membership drive, especially as the party had been working hard to ensure Okowa’s election victory. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
