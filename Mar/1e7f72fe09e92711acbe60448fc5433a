Nigeria will play Poland and Serbia this March in twin friendly matches aimed at preparing the team for the World Cup. Only last week, the coach released list of players invited for the friendlies. Rohr, who spoke in Lagos at the weekend, said that the goal he wants to achieve with the friendly games was to see team cohension and team spirit. “What I want to achieve is cohension, team spirit and friendly atmosphere,” he said. “We are playing Poland, Serbia to prepare for the World Cup and we don’t pray for injuries,” he added. “We have to play with caution and prepare well for the World Cup.” The coach who watched the league match between Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) and Heartland of Owerri at the Agege Stadium expressed shock at the use of systhentic pitches. “I also noticed that the league is being played on synthetic pitches. That is old-fashioned because the sun is not favourable playing on such turf. “Synthetic pitches are hot during the sun and it is not the best for the players,’’ he said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
