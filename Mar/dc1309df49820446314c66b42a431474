Oleh – Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State said proactive steps taken to curtail herdsmen and farmers clashes brought minimal attack by the herders. Giving the hint at Isiokolo, headquarters of Ethiope East Local Government Area, in continuation of his state-wide town hall meeting with stakeholders, Okowa assured Deltans that his administration stood by no grazing land for cattle policy. The governor posited that his government, through Skills Training and Entrepreneurship Programme (STEP) and Youths Agricultural Entrepreneurs Programme (YAGEP) programmes, would continue to encourage agriculture, stressing that land for farming is paramount to provide food security for the people. He reiterated that at the federal level, a committee headed by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, with one person each from the six geo-political zones, had been drafted by the Federal Government to fashion out ways and make policy that would bring to an end herdsmen and farmers clashes in the country. “But while waiting for the Federal Government to formulate policy, we as a people would continue to engage critical stakeholders, including security chiefs, community leaders and opinion leaders, to ensure that our farmers are safe and their crops not destroyed. “We will continue to call on the Federal Government to come out with definitive policy concerning herdsmen,” the governor said. He tasked the people to give peace a chance while the government does the needful to safeguard lives and property. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
