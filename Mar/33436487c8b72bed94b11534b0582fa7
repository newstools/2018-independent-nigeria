Worried by the recurring industrial actions by health workers in the state, the Edo State Government says work on a holistic plan for workers in the sector has reached advanced stage. Crusoe Osagie, Special Adviser to Governor Godwin Obaseki on Media and Communication Strategy, described the health sector as a major pillar of the government’s overall policy framework for the state and appealed to the striking workers to be patient with the state government. Osagie said: “The Edo State Government is adopting a holistic approach to the reform of the health sector in the state. We urge the health professionals to exercise some patience, as hasty and tokenistic efforts cannot produce the high standard of healthcare the Obaseki-led government has envisioned for Edo people. “The plans have been made and partners are being sourced, and in good time, the results will manifest.” He added that the governor had tremendous respect for health workers and would not turn a deaf ear to issues that affect their welfare. “As you are aware, Governor Obaseki is passionate about getting the health sector to contribute significantly to his administration’s overall goal. This informs his personal involvement in healthcare programmes, from immunisation to the distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets and the commitment to the construction of primary healthcare centres across the state.” The governor’s aide assured that the health sector would receive more than the usual attention in the months that will follow the unveiling of the reforms for the sector. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
