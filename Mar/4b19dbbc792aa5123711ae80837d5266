Abuja – Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has tasked security operatives to isolate genuine herders and fish out killers as well as criminals masquerading as herdsmen in the country. Speaking on a live radio programme monitored by DAILY INDEPENDENT in Abuja on Monday, Othman Ngelzerma, the secretary-general, said criminal elements had infiltrated the herdsmen and go about maiming and killing innocent Nigerians across some states in the country. He spoke against the backdrop of calls by various organisations asking for the declaration of herdsmen as terrorist group in the country. While trying to exonerate members of his association from the incessant killing of farmers and other innocent Nigerians, Ngelzerma said the association had been registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) over the last 32 years. He rather blamed the incessant clashes between farmers and herdsmen, and its attendant killings, on age-long neglect by relevant authorities to nip the crisis in the bud. As part of solutions to the clashes between herdsmen and farmers, the MACBAN scribe urged the 19 northern governors to establish open grazing reserves for herders. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
