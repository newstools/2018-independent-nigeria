Lagos – Players of Plateau United and Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries believe that qualifying for the group stage of the CAF Champions League will be a tough one going by the results the teams recorded in the first leg first round of the qualifying series. While MFM on Wednesday defeated Alger of Algeria 2-1 in Agege to take a slim lead to the second leg in Algiers, Plateau United will need to overhaul a 4-2 first leg loss to Etoil du Sahel in Jos in theoir second leg match. Speaking to DAILY INDEPENDENT on Wednesday at Agege, MFM’s Okorom Stanley and Uwaga Chuka said that they envisaged tough battle in Algeria. According to Stanley, “It’s good that we won the match but it is going to be tough in Algeria. They will do everything to frustrate us but we will give them a fight and hopefully come back with the right result.” “We are going to battle the weather, the crowd and intimidation, but hey, we will do our best to stop them,” noted Chuka. Also, Dele Ajiboye of Plateau United noted that they have a big battle on their hands when they host Etoile in Jos. “Losing 4-2 was not what we planned for but we are not leaving anything to chance because the battle ahead is much. We need everybody’s support and prayers at this time,” he told DAILY INDEPENDENT. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
