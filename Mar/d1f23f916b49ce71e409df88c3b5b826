Turkish authorities were increasing security around the capital to thwart possible attacks, the Ankara governor’s office announced on Monday, as the U.S. embassy in the city said it was closed due to a “security threat.” At the same time, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu News Agency reported security forces had detained 12 alleged members of the Islamic State extremist group. It added that they were seeking to capture eight additional suspects, in line with warrants from a prosecutor. The governor’s office said it had received intelligence from U.S. sources on possible terrorist threats and was upping security around the embassy and locations used by U.S. citizens in the Turkish capital. “Embassy Ankara informs U.S. citizens that the U.S. embassy in Ankara will be closed to the public on March 5, 2018, due to a security threat. “The embassy will announce its reopening, once it resumes services,’’ a security alert from the mission said. The capital saw a wave of attacks in 2015 and 2016 in which hundreds were killed. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
