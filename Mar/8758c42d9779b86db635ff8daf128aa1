UK police have expanded their investigation of the nerve-agent poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the city of Salisbury and confirmed that hospitals have treated 21 people since the pair were found unconscious on Sunday. The police reportedly sealed off a car recovery garage and erected three cordons and evidence tents around Skripal’s home in the city, leading to speculation that he may not have been poisoned at a pub or a restaurant that were cordoned off earlier. They also cordoned off the graves of Skripal’s wife and son, close to his home in Salisbury, The Guardian and other media said. Home Secretary Amber Rudd visited Salisbury on Friday with Kier Pritchard, chief constable of Wiltshire Police. Pritchard identified a 38-year-old policeman who was poisoned, after visiting him in hospital on Thursday, saying he remained in serious condition but was “conscious, talking and engaging with people.” He told broadcaster ITV News that 21 people had attended hospital with possible poisoning symptoms, including the police officer and the Skripals. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov on Friday accused Western media and politicians of “propaganda and … trying to raise tensions” over the poisoning. “We shouldn’t dash to the TV screen with unfounded accusations,” Lavrov told journalists during a visit to Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. Many British media reports and some politicians have suggested a probable link to the Russian government. Opposition Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper wrote to Rudd urging her to review 14 other cases of Russians who died in Britain. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
