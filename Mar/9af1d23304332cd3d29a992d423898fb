Croatia national team head coach Zlatko Dalić, confirmed that his scouts would attend all the matches involving their Group D opponents (Argentina, Iceland and Nigeria) at the World Cup this month, including the Super Eagles game against Serbia in London.
”Yes, Ladić goes to America. I needed a man who would monitor Iceland’s game, Ivica Olić would probably look at the other game,” said Dalic to Sportske Novosti.
”At the same time Nikola Jerkan will follow Argentina playing with Italy and Spain, while Ognjen Vukojević will watch Nigeria against Poland and Serbia.
