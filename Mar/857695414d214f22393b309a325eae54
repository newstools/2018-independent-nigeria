Lagos – The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Ports and Terminal Multipurpose Services Limited, Tin Can Island, Apapa said it netted revenue of N7.2bn in February, 2018. This was against N6.9 generated by the command in the corresponding period of 2017. It would be recalled that the command also generated N9.9bn to the Federal Government’s coffers in January this year. The command led by Comptroller Mrs. Aremu Modupe said the revenue in the first two months of the year surpassed their corresponding periods of January and February, 2017. A comparative analysis of the revenue generated during the periods in a statement by Yakubu Mohammed, the Customs Public Relations Officer, PTML, command, noted that the feat was achieved as a result of increased cargo throughput and diligence on the part of officers and men of her command, through blockade of revenue leakages and the comptroller’s insistence that due process must always be followed in the transaction of clearing cargos at the PTML command. Aremu also stated that officers and men of his command had undergone training and re-training along with the stakeholders who often held meetings together and enlightenment programmes towards achieving the Executive Order on the Ease of Doing Business in the port. She added that the command had since keyed into the pogramme, which had resulted in greater trade facilitation in her command. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
