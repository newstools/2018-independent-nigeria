Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday ordered law enforcement officers to suppress extremist activities as the number of such crimes increased 5 per cent in the country in 2017. Putin said at the annual expanded meeting of the Interior Ministry Board that countering extremism is one of the ministry’s priorities. According to him, some groups incited ethnic and religious intolerance, organised unauthorised public events and attempted to recruit young people via social networks. “We should firmly suppress the activities of such groups and bring their organisers to justice. “Any illegal action aimed at splitting society and destabilising the situation is a serious threat to the country’s security,’’ Putin added. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
