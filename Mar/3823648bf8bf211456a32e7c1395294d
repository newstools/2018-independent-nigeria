Lagos – Algeria’s Lynda Logrhaibi has described her victory over Nigeria’s Edem Offiong in the ongoing ITTF Africa Top 16 Cup in Nairobi, Kenya as a sweet one in the history of her career. Offiong, seeded number four, was the one of the top seeds in the tournament that tested defeats on the opening day of the tournament. For Algeria’s Loghraibi, the victory against Offiong was a sweet one. “I thought that beating Edem will be an impossible task for me because I have never beaten her in our previous meetings. “But today, I was calm and relaxed because I had nothing to lose if she defeated me. I was just playing and enjoying myself. So beating Edem today is like defeating Oshonaike or Meshref because she is one the best players in Africa. I am so happy because this will motivate me in this competition,” the Algerian admitted. Meanwhile, the tournament continued on Friday with the knockout matches as Nigeria’s Aruna Quadri battled Ghana’s Derek Abrefa, Egypt’s Omar Assar played Tunisia’s Mamia Thameur, Segun Toriola faced Congo Brazzaville’s Saheed Idowu while the last quarterfinal match was between Egypt’s Ahmed Saleh and Algeria’s Sami Kherouf.

The last quarterfinal match was between Egypt’s Farah Abdel-Aziz and Algeria’s Loghraibi. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
