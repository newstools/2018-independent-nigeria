Former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe says South Africa should have sent troops instead of a team of negotiators to prevent his ouster by the military last year. Mugabe said his regional neighbours betrayed him “in a sense”, in an interview with the privately-owned Zimbabwe Independent newspaper and other regional and international media. “When you look at their conditions, except for South Africa, they haven’t got the capacity to intervene,” the 94-year-old is quoted as saying. The former first lady had cultivated a factional support base within ZANU-PF known as “G-40” that was seen as hostile to the security establishment. South Africa’s then President Jacob Zuma had sent Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and the then state security minister Bongani Bongo to intervene in the impasse between Mugabe and the military. Mugabe, who once quipped that he would rule until he turned 100, described his departure from office as a “coup d’etat.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
