Several thousand Syrian rebels and civilians began leaving a ravaged pocket of Eastern Ghouta on Sunday, in fresh evacuations that further emptied the former rebel bastion. Five weeks since the Syrian regime launched an all-out assault on Ghouta, it holds more than 90 percent of the onetime opposition stronghold on the edge of Damascus. To help it capture the rest, key backer Russia has held talks with various rebel groups to negotiate withdrawals from the three remaining pockets. One area was emptied in recent days under such a deal and evacuations began late Saturday for a second part, held by the Islamist Faylaq al-Rahman rebel faction. That agreement is set to see some 7,000 rebels and civilians bussed from the towns of Arbin and Zamalka and the district of Jobar to the rebel-dominated province of Idlib in northwestern Syria. Around 980 of them quit Ghouta late Saturday, travelling overnight on buses and ambulances to northwest Syria. Evacuations resumed on Sunday, with more than 3,700 fighters, relatives, and other civilians boarding dozens of buses to leave Ghouta, state news agency SANA said. The vehicles snaked their way through Ghouta neighbourhoods that had been reduced to ruins, as residents who chose to stay waved silently from the rubble to their departing neighbours. An AFP correspondent saw some buses exiting rebel territory and driving onto the nearby highway on Sunday afternoon, but they were delayed there for several hours as they waited for the full convoy to gather. By nightfall, buses were still paused at the highway. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
