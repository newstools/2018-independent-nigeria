A Court in Turkey on Friday sentenced 600 people allegedly linked to the movement of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, and accused by Ankara of masterminding the 2016 failed coup attempt, have been given life sentences. Since July 2016, Turkish courts have delivered verdicts on 106 cases out of 283 linked to the defeated coup, the Anadolu news agency reported. In these 106 cases, a total of 592 suspects out of 805 were sentenced to life in prison. Among them there were 22 former generals, 166 officers, 31 petty officers, a sergeant, 17 military students and four engineers. Turkish prosecutors continue to seek life sentences for more suspects, the media outlet added. Following the failed government overturn in July 2016, Ankara has arrested thousands of public servants, military personnel, education workers, activists and journalists over suspected links to Gulen, who has been living in exile in the U.S. The cleric has repeatedly denied the allegations of the failed coup organisation. The UN Human Rights Council has voiced its concerns over the worsening human rights situation in Turkey, urging Ankara to stop mass dismissals and punishing family members of individuals suspected of offences. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
