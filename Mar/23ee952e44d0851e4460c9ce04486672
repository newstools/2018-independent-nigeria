Lagos – The Nigerian equities market sustained its positive performance for the second consecutive week as the All Share Index (ASI) rose 0.7 per cent week-on-week to 43,167.87 points while year-to-date return improved to 12.9 per cent. This is attributed to the largely positive performance of buying interest in medium cap stocks in anticipation of the release of earnings scorecards. Consequently, market capitalisation increased by N104.8 billion to settle at N15.5 trillion. In the same vein, activity level strengthened as average volume and value traded rose 27.6 per cent and 1.9 per cent to 553.7 million units and N7.9 billion respectively. Chemical and Allied Products  (309.0m), Zenith Bank (131.0m) and Sterling Bank (123.7m) were the top traded stocks by volume while Guaranty Trust Bank  (N4.6bn), Zenith Bank (N4.0bn) and Dangote Cement (N2.1bn) were the top traded by value. The bourse kicked off the week with a bullish performance (ASI jumped 1.5%) due to gains in Dangote Cement, Seplat petroleum Development Company and Guaranty Trust Bank. This was sustained on Tuesday, as the benchmark index gained 0.66 per cent on the back of buying interest in Seplat Petroleum Development Company  and Unilever Nigeria ; the rally in the former largely stems from the impressive earnings recorded for FY:2017 and positive outlook on performance for 2018. Midweek, investors booked profit in previous advancers – Dangote Cement, Nigerian Breweries and Guaranty Trust Bank – which dragged the All Share Index  1.5 per cent lower. On Thursday, the market rebounded, up 0.3 per cent primarily due to upticks in Unilever Nigeria, Stanbic IBTC and Guaranty Trust Bank and this was extended into Friday (+0.2%). Across sectors, performance was largely mixed as three of five indices closed in the green. The Oil & Gas appreciated the most, up 5.6 per cent largely driven by rally in Seplat Petroleum Development Company (+12.1%). The consumer and Industrial Goods indices followed suit, rising 1.7 per cent apiece following gains in Unilever Nigeria (+20.7%) Flour Mills of Nigeria (+12.1%), WAPCO (+3.9%) and Beta Glass (+5.0%). On the flipside, price depreciation in Zenith Bank (-2.1%), Guaranty Trust Bank (-1.6%), WAPIC Insurance (-7.7%) and AIICO Insurance (-5.5%) dragged the banking and insurance indices 1.1 per cent and 0.7 per cent lower week-on-week. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
