There is the possibility that Brazilian and Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, could miss the FIFA World Cup kicking off this June in Russia due to injury. Neymar cracked the fifth metatarsal in his right foot and hurt his ankle during Sunday’s 3-0 win over Marseille and will undergo surgery on Saturday in Brazil. His expected recovery could take up to three months, according to the Brazil team doctor. It is bellieved that the player may not recover well enough from the surgery before the tournament kicks off. The 26-year-old has arrived in Rio de Janeiro ahead of the operation on Saturday. Doctor Rodrigo Lasmar arrived with Neymar and said: “The (recovery) period will be around two and a half to three months.” Brazilian team spokesman Vinicius Rodrigues says surgery will be performed in Belo Horizonte and is “99 per cent” sure to take place on Saturday. The former Barcelona man was stretchered off in tears after he was hurt in a challenge from Bouna Sarr. A subsequent PSG statement read: “After an initial treatment period of three days in line with a strict medical protocol, a joint decision has been taken between the medical staffs of both Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team. “In accordance with the player, it has been decided that Neymar will undergo surgery in Brazil at the end of this week.” Neymar will be out until April at the very earliest. He will miss the clash with Real Madrid on March 6. He would also likely miss PSG’s remaining 11 league games. He is out of the World Cup friendlies that Brazil had lined up for the end of March – games against hosts Russia and reigning champions Germany. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
