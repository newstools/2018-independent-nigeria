Lagos – The population of global Internet users will hit 5.026 billion in the next 7 years, from 3.278 billion in 2017. According to a recent report by GSMA, 61per cent of the world’s population will be connected to the internet by 2025, a 41.8 percent increase over that of 2017. Of that figure, Sub-Saharan Africa’s internet population which is currently at 211 million  is expected to contribute 495 million to this number which is a 130 per cent growth. A 130 per cent growth within seven years is great but is still relatively small considering that the population of Sub-Saharan Africa currently at 1.04 billion and is expected to reach 1.24 billion by 2025. Mobile subscriptions in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2025 will be at 638 million, out of the global subscription of 5.859 billion. An affirmation that mobile is still a big deal, especially in Africa and this has been proven in time past to have a greater reach than any other form of technology. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
