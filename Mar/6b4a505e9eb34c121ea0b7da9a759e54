A referee is facing murder charges after football players forced him to kill a member of an opposing team in southern Malawi, police said Friday. The referee was refereeing a football match between two local teams, Billiat FC and Chilengo FC, in the town of Thyolo on Wednesday, when Chilengo FC players refused to accept the referee’s decision to invalidate a goal, district police spokesman Benjamin Foster told dpa. In the ensuing scuffle, the referee fled to a nearby house, which the players lit on fire to smoke him out, according to Foster. When the referee ran out of the burning building, the players forced him to beat a Billiat FC player with a stick, the spokesman said. The player later died of his injuries in hospital, added Foster. “The referee turned himself over … He is facing murder charges,” he said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
