Lagos – The equities market halted a three-week long bearish performance last week on the back of increased buying interest in market bellwethers as earnings results begin to trickle in. Accordingly, the NSE All Share Index (ASI) rose 0.7 per cent week-on-week to settle at 42,876.23 points, as year-to-date return improved to 12.1 per cent, while market capitalisation increased by N126.0 billion to N15.4 trillion. Similarly, activity level strengthened as average volume and value traded improved 7.5 per cent and 79.9 per cent week-on-week to 403.1 million units and N9.1 billion respectively. The top traded stocks by volume were First City Monument Bank (237.4m), Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (167.6m) and Transnational Corporation (154.0m) while the top traded stocks by value were Nestle Nigeria (N5.2bn), Guaranty Trust Bank (N4.3bn) and Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (N2.9bn). A mixed performance was recorded in the market last week as the NSE ASI advanced on three of five trading days in the week. The benchmark index started the week flattish with a 0.02 per cent appreciation, but declined 0.7 per cent on Tuesday following sell offs in Dangote Cement, Zenith Bank and International Breweries. On Wednesday, the ASI rebounded, gaining 2.4 per cent against the backdrop of renewed interest in industrial and consumer goods bellwethers – Dangote Cement, Nigerian Breweries and Nestle Nigeria. However, on Thursday the ASI dipped 1.1 per cent due to profit taking before improving 0.1 per cent on Friday. All sector indices advanced, save for the banking index which declined 0.6 per cent week-on-week on the back of profit taking in Guaranty Trust Bank (-0.2%) and Zenith Bank (-1.1%). On the gainers’ chart, the oil & gas Index was the top advancer, up 1.6 per cent week-on-week, due to gains in Total Nigeria (+6.4%) and Seplat Petroleum Development Company (+2.2%). Interest in the latter was buoyed by the release of an impressive Full Year 2017 earnings scorecard whilst the performance in the former was driven by attractive dividend yield of 6.5 per cent as at declaration. During the week, 37 stocks closed in the green while 44 stocks declined. Hence, market breadth (advance/decline ratio) strengthened to 0.8x from 0.4x in the previous week, indicating an improvement in investor sentiment. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
