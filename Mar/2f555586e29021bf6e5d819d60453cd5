Osogbo – Senator Oluwole Alabi, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State, has ruled out the possibility of Senator Iyiola Omisore, former deputy governor of the state, dumping the party. Featuring on a radio programme monitored in Osogbo, Alabi said Omisore was still a bona-fide member of the PDP family. Saying though Omisore did not attend the Sunday state congress of the party held at the Osogbo Sports Stadium, because of certain development that trailed the congress, Alabi added that the party would soon begin to reconcile all aggrieved members of the party to bring them back on fold. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
