FIFA has revealed the prize money teams taking partÂ  at the World Cup kicking off in June in Russia will receive as the each of the 32 qualified teams are guaranteed a minimum of $8 million at the group stage. This is the least that a participating federation would earn as the amounts for going further in the competition increases. While $8 million was the same amount received by countries that only lasted in the group phase of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, there is a significant increase starting from the knockout phase. The Super Eagles got $9 million for reaching the second round at the 2014 event in Brazil, however, should Super Eagles qualify for the second round, they would get $12 million as a result of the new price review. As opposed to $14 million handed to quarterfinalists in 2014, teams unable to progress past the last-eight would each receive $16 million. Defending champions Germany got $35 million, while second-placed Argentina were handed $25 million, Netherlands and hosts Brazil $22 million and $20 million for finishing third and fourth respectively. In Russia, the winning federation would get $38 million, while the runners-up, third and fourth teams would get $28 million, $24 million and $22 million respectively. Nigeria, which have been drawn against Croatia, Iceland and Argentina in group D, will kick off their campaign against Croatia June 16 before playing Iceland June 22 and Argentina June 26. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
