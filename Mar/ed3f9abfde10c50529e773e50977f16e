Warri – The people of Edjeba community in Agbarha, Warri Kingdom, in Warri South Loval Government Area of Delta State, have appealed to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to look into the issue of abandoned Warri Industrial Park project sited in their community. The community leaders, who took Sunday INDEPENDENT round the abandoned site, said the project was close to their chest, even as they appealed to Gov. Okowa to fix the industrial park in the overall interest of the people and government of the state. Shola Godwin, Chairman, Edjeba Development Committee, said: “When the former governor, Dr Emmanuel Eweta Uduaghan, took the bold step to flag off the administrative block of the Warri Industrial Park, we were so happy because the project is indeed pivotal to the manifestation of the zone as an industrial hub of the state. “Today, contrary to our expectations, we are rather taken aback by the inability of the Okowa regime to kick start the project. To be candid, the stalemated Warri Industrial Park site that is permanently vacated without any green light of how soon government can look at that direction is to us the community leaders a retrogressive journey for the government and people of Delta. “Whatever the hiccups may be l believe that the project is too important to be pushed to the back burner due to its viable economic potential. “We are using this platform to appeal passionately to Gov. Okowa to kindly direct the Hon. Commissioner for Commerce and Industry, Dr. Mary Iyasere, the Commissioner for Energy and other relevant stakeholders to prevail on the powers that be to move the project from a pipe dream into reality.” 6 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
