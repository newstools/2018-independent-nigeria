U.S. President Donald Trump and Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan on Wednesday discussed ways to enhance “friendship and cooperation’’ between the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) during a phone call. “The U.S. president thanked Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan for his leadership role in mobilising regional and international support to effectively counter the destabilising activities of Iran. “While the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi thanked President Trump for his key role in combating extremism and terrorism,’’ the local news reported. It said that the two sides also agreed on the importance of regional cooperation and the role of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in reducing regional threats and ensuring the economic prosperity of the region. Founded in 1981, the GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman. In 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt accused Qatar of “supporting terrorism’’ and “undermining regional security’’ by seeking closer ties with Iran. Qatar strongly denied what it called the “unjustified’’ and “baseless’’ accusations. The standoff, rather than showing any signs of abating, has been exacerbated by Trump’s remarks in June that Qatar had funded terrorism “at a very high level.’’ 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
