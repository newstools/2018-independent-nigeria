The Islamic State terrorist organisation is far from being defeated, new German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in his first speech to parliament in his new role on Thursday. “Our successes are fragile,” Maas told the lower house, or Bundestag, the day after being sworn in as foreign minister. He said that the international coalition fighting Islamic State had had many successes and the group no longer held sway in Iraq, but they were far from defeated and the fight against them must be continued. “To let up would be completely the wrong signal right now,’’ Maas said. The Bundestag was debating the possible extension and expansion of German military operations around the world, especially against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and a separate operation in Afghanistan. Germany currently trains troops in the northern Kurdish region of Iraq; the plan is to expand the mission over the whole country. The Bundestag is not expected to vote on the military missions, but it is expected that their extension and expansion will be passed soon as they have been agreed by the parties in the new grand coalition that was sworn in on Wednesday 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
