A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) Jandor will host the Under 14 boys’ soccer competition on Sunday, March 18, 2018 at the Legacy Pitch of the National Stadium, Surulere, Lagos. Speaking during a media chat, the founder of the NGO and chairman of Core cable television, Olajide Odediran who was represented by his personal assistant, Akeem Yusuf said Jandor’s attention has to shift from its usual youth education empowerment and development to youth soccer development sequel to the immense football talents available in Nigeria. “Soccer is a very important part of our lives, training the body physically and mentally including talent discovery will totally keep idle youths off the streets” Odediran insisted that he decided to sponsor youth soccer competitions after a complete overview of his background where nobody assisted him while growing up in an environment surrounded with poverty. He noted that it is not only when one has millions that he can help others in need, any little help can go a long way in putting talented boys and girls on the podium of history. The football competition which would be rounded up on Sunday would see the winner chart home the sum of N200.000 and a trophy, the second placed team will pocket N150.000 while the third place team will go home with N50.000 The sponsor assured that, any talent discovered in the football competition could be considered for scholarship as an incentive for educationally minded youth. The first grassroots competition the NGO would be sponsoring is already at its semifinal stage as Greater Tomorrow FC from Itire, squares up against Soccer Right FC, Ikate, Lagos, while Zamatek FC of Agege will face another team in the semifinal clash on Wednesday in Lagos. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
