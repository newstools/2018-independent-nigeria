Stuart Baxter’s Bafana Bafana beat Zambia 2-0 on Saturday night to win the Four Nations tournament at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium. Percy Tau and Lebogang Mothiba scored the goals for the visitors, who will no doubt be boosted by the result as Baxter looks to get the side moving in the right direction. Tau’s goal came in the 15th minute, while Bafana goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune pulled off a string of fine saves on the night to keep the Zambians scoreless. It was never safe, though, and only when Mothiba scored in the 91st minute of the contest could Baxter and Bafana begin to relax. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
