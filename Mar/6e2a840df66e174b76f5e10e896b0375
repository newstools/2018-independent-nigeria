Akure – Twenty-seven workers of Ondo State Afforestation Project sacked in January have decried the refusal of the private firm operating the state forests to pay their 28 months outstanding salaries. The state government had in May last year ceded control of the project to West Africa Forest Plantation and promised to offset all salary arrears owed the former staff. The disengaged workers, in a letter to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, described non-payment of their outstanding salaries as inhuman and unjust. They called on the governor to wade into the issue and save them from further untold hardship which their retrenchment and unpaid salary arrears had caused. The sacked forestry staff alleged that since the private firm took over the afforestation, they had not been paid despite the governor’s directive to that effect. “As a matter of fact, our living condition has worsened. We are jobless now and in disarray. We cannot meet up with the most basic obligations and necessities of life. “Our children are out of school. Some of us have gone to their early grave due to lack of money to maintain body and soul,” they wrote in the letter. They said Weluche Ume, the Managing Director of the company, had promised to pay them in December last year but failed, adding that he had continued to unjustly sack workers at the company. Weluche, however, claimed that the matter was being handled by the state Ministry of Natural Resources. Rasheed Badmus, the state Commissioner for Natural Resources, also said the plight of the workers would soon be looked into by the state government. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
