The Turkish government decided to freeze the assets of late Yemeni President Ali Saleh and the leaders of the Houthi rebels for one year, local media reported on Friday. The Anadolu news agency reported that the decision of Ankara was made on the ground of the February resolution of the UN Security Council, which prolongs the sanctions imposed on Yemen. Ankara will also block the bank accounts of Saleh’s son. The situation in Yemen has been extremely unstable since 2015 when a civil war broke out. The war is being waged between the internationally recognised government of President AbdRabbuh Hadi and the Houthi movement once backed by army units loyal to Saleh. In March 2015, the Saudi-led coalition of mostly Persian Gulf countries launched airstrikes against the Houthis at Hadi’s request. The conflict escalated in late November, when clashes in Sanaa between the Houthis and Saleh’s units broke out. On Dec. 4, shortly after reaffirming the end of his alliance with the Houthis, Saleh was killed by the rebels. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
