It is no longer news that the gossip queen herself, Linda Ikeji is finally engaged. The 38 year-old web billionaire has been open about her single status and had even broken down on her blog not understanding why she is still single. Personally, I got a hint of why when she had an interview with a Saturday INDEPENDENT reporter some time last year. She had said that she cannot marry a man who lives in a three bedroom apartment in Lekki, Lagos. As we all know, Lekki is one of the highbrow and expensive places to live in Lagos; though Ikeji herself lives in the more exclusive part of Lagos, Banana Island. I believe she does have a taste for the rich and affluent men. We are yet to know who her man his. I do hope he ticks all her boxes including having a home in Banana Island. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
