Abuja – The House of Representatives has asked Solomon Dalong, Minister of Sports and officials of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria, (AFN), to appear before it to explain an alleged disappearance of $150, 000 from the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF). This is coming as the IAAF has threatened to ban the country if the missing money is not recovered. The revelation followed the debate on a motion over the disappearance of the money given by the international body to AFN, alleging that the IAAF has threatened to ban Nigeria from International competitions. Debating the motion on matter of urgent public importance sponsored by Diri Duoye, the lawmakers disclosed that IAAF reportedly paid $150,000 to AFN, instead of $15,000 an annual grant to member federation for 2017 and alleged that the AFN disappeared with the money paid in error. The lawmakers expressed concern that the image of the country has been tarnished at the international arena as well as stand the risk of being banned from International competitions. According to the house it is ridiculous at this period the government is fighting corruption that such colossal sums would be received and misappropriated by anyone against statutory laws of the land. They, however, mandated the committee on sports to conduct  a forensic audit on how the alleged looting of the excess grant payment and determine how the money can be refunded to IAAF. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
