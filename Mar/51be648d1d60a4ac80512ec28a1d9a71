Lagos – MTN’s earnings bounced to profit for the year ended 31 December 2017, although the strong Rand dented revenue growth and new subscriber definitions saw active customer numbers tumble. The telecoms giant returned to annual profit in 2017 in the absence of one-off charges related to a $1.1 billion fine imposed on it the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) over failure to meet the deadline to deactivate some unregistered lines on its network. The group also plans to spend a total of R27.7 billion, about $580m, in 2018, with the guidance of South Africa at R9.6 billion and for Nigeria at R6.9 billion. Besides, network operator, at the weekend, reported positive headline earnings per share (HEPS) of 182 cents compared to a full-year headline loss per share of 77 cents at the end of 2016. “We are back in the black, with an attributable profit for the full year of R4.4 billion, as you know we had a loss of R2.6 billion in 2016,” group CEO Rob Shuter said in a conference call. The group’s revenue for the 12 months increased by 6.8% on a constant currency basis, but was actually down by 10.2%, at R132.8 billion, when currency changes were included. The group’s service revenue was also hit by the strong rand during the period, decreasing by 10.8% to R124.4 billion, but would have been up 7.2% had the currency remained constant. “The stronger rand and the significant year-on-year (YOY) depreciation of the naira against the US dollar had a negative translation impact on rand-reported results for the period. The average Naira depreciated by 25.8% against the US dollar in the year, and the closing rate was down 13.1% YOY. The average Rand strengthened by 9.6% against the US dollar YOY, and the rand closed 10.7% stronger. In light of recent developments in SA, we expect the rand to remain robust throughout 2018,” the group said. Reported data revenue increased by 19.4% to R28.2 billion. Digital revenue decreased by 6.9%, to R13 billion, but would have been up by 14% on a constant currency basis. “The digital revenue is slightly disappointing, and there are two things going on in there: a very strong performance by Mobile Money and by our new rich media services, but a lot of pressure in the old value-added services subscription business, where we have been doing a big optimisation of that business largely in Nigeria,” Shuter said. Active MTN Mobile Money customers increased from 16.1million to 21.8 million across the group an increase of 5.7 million. Group voice revenue was largely flat. Shuter said: “Ideally, long-term flat voice revenue is a pretty good achievement,” although Nigeria actually saw outgoing voice revenue increase by 7.5% for the year. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) grew 15.2% for the year, to R46 billion, while the EBITDA margin decreased by 1.4 percentage points to 34%. Capital expenditure (capex) for the year was close to R31.5 billion, slightly higher than the previous guidance of R30 billion. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
