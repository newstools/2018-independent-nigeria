Katsina – European Union (EU) Grant Project, in collaboration with the management of Umaru Musa Yar’Adua University (UMYU) in Katsina State, says it has trained 8,460 farmers on nursery practices and agro-forestry management in the state.
The Project is said to be coordinated by its Energy Centre on Sustainable Development of Farm Agro-forestry and Fuel Wood Conservation in five local governments of Batagarawa, Jibia, Kaita, Rimi and Batsari.
Professor Idris Isa Funtua, the Vice Chancellor of UMYU, who disclosed this to newsmen over the weekend, said the institution in synergy with the Project also trained 1,000 women and youth belonging to Community-Based Organisations (CBOs) on how to process fruits.
According to the VC, “there was the distribution of about 4.2 million seedling to farmers within the last three years that were produced by 344 private nursery owners and the training of about 1,000 porters on the production of improved mud wood stoves.”
He added that the university, through its Microfinance Bank, designed a product exclusively for women in the state to enable them access soft loans of N5,000.
His words, “The loan was to be repaid within three months through weekly repayment of N455 and a weekly compulsory saving of N350 for a period of 13 weeks.
“The scheme commenced with 15 women from Dabaibayawa village in March 2017. Presently, 550 women from the following villages of Batagarawa local government: Angawa/Autawa, Tsanni, Yar’gamji, Bakiyawa, Dandagoro and Ajiwa are enrolled and are having 100 per cent compliance.” 2 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
