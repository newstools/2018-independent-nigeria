Almost 7,000 Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras will be operating at Moscow polling stations during the upcoming presidential election to ensure public safety, an official said. Vladimir Chernikov, the Head of Moscow Government’s Department on Regional Security and Countering Corruption, said this on Friday in Moscow. Chernikov said “to ensure security at polling stations, more than 1,500 ballot processing complexes (BPCs) were purchased, while polling stations were equipped with almost 7,000 surveillance cameras – two cameras at a station.” The premises, located near the local election commissions, will be checked by the authorities a day before the election, the official noted. “All buildings adjacent to the polling stations, as well as the attics and cellars, will be inspected by representatives of housing and communal organisations and by the Interior Ministry’s officers. “Additional checks will be held directly on the eve of the Election Day,” Chernikov added. The polling stations and adjacent territories will also be taken under round-the-clock protection and will be verified by technical means and service dogs during the Election Day, according to the official. “Near the buildings, where the voting will be held, the police officers will be operating the access control with the use of metal detectors,” the department’s chief underlined. The Russian presidential election is scheduled for March 18, while the campaign kicked off on December 18. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
