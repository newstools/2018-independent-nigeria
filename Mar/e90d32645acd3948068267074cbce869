Awka – Anambra State House of Assembly has called on the state’s Director of National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) to check proliferation of unlicensed sachet water manufacturers in the state. The motion moved by Lawrence Ezeudu representing Dunukofia constituency was aimed at protecting public and environmental health. Ezeudu explained that some of the sachet water manufacturers operating in Anambra were not registered with NAFDAC, while some counterfeit the agency’s registration number and sell substandard water to members of the public. This, according to the lawmaker, has resulted in water-borne diseases like cholera, typhoid fever and a host of others. Timothy Ifedioramm (Njikoka) posited that there should be routine visits to sachet water factories, to ascertain the level of hygiene observed and quality control measures in the production process. Ifedioramma equally added that relevant authorities should swing into action immediately to commence withdrawal of licences of manufacturers not operating according to standards. Meanwhile, Somto Udeze (Ogbaru 2) suggested the urgent need to consider the storage of the sachet waters in some industries, as most were stored haphazardly in some factories. Harford Oseke, the deputy speaker who presided over the plenary, said that the Assembly would mandate the NAFDAC director in the state to, as matter of urgent public importance, check proliferation of unregistered and unlicensed sachet water manufacturers in the state. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
