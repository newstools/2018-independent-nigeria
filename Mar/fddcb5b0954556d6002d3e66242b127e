A day after the members of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) voted to join a coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, the German government announced three new ministers on Monday. All three ministers are from the Christian Social Union (CSU), Merkel’s Bavarian-based allies. Andreas Scheuer, former CSU secretary general, will be the new transport minister; Gerd Mueller maintains the development portfolio, while Dorothee Baer will take on the digitalisation ministry. It had previously been announced that CSU party leader Horst Seehofer would take on an expanded Interior Ministry. Sunday’s Yes vote by the SPD membership cleared the way for a revival of the so-called grand coalition between the SPD, CSU and Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), which has governed Germany since 2013. An inconclusive election result in September has left Germany without a new government for almost six months. The Bundestag is set to officially elect Merkel as chancellor of Germany when it convenes on March 14. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
