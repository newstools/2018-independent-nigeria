Many penny stocks posted price depreciation on the Nigerian Stock Exchange  (NSE) for the month of February, with Consolidated Hallmark emerging the worst performing stock in percentage terms. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the stock, which opened trading for the month at 50k, lost 48 per cent to close at 26k per share, due to exchange new pricing method. Data obtained from the NSE indicated that Unic Diversified Holdings, another penny stock, came second, dropping by 47.83 per cent to close at 24k per share against opening price of 46k. Courtville Business Solutions dipped 46 per cent to close at 27k against 50k, while Mutiverse lost 37.5 per cent to close the month at 30k per share compared with the opening price of 48k. NAN reports that new pricing method commenced on Jan. 29. Dr Uche Uwaleke, Head of Banking and Finance Department, Nasarawa State University Keffi,  told NAN in Lagos that the new pricing methodology led to losses posted by most penny stocks. “It is the new pricing methodology that has injected liquidity into those penny stocks which allowed their prices to fall below 50k,” Uwaleke said. He said that the development  also indicated an increase in domestic investor participation in the stock market. “Unlike foreign investors who show more interest in high-cap stocks, a good number of domestic investors take positions in penny stocks given their affordability,” he said. Uwaleke said that the new method was aimed at improving liquidity, narrowing spreads and ensuring that all price-improving transactions had impact. He said that the new rule would effectively remove the previous rule which placed minimum allowable price for any stock to trade at its nominal value, irrespective of the market forces. According to him, it specifies that stock prices will be determined by market forces of demand and supply, as prices can fall below the initial price. Mr Ambrose Omordion,  the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd. also atrributed the development to the new pricing rule. Omordion added that the losses posted by some second tier  banking stocks were due to profit-taking following rally posted at the beginning of the year.
