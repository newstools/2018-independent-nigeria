The Guild of Sports Editors, which is the umbrella body for all managers of sports in Nigeria, has congratulated the newly elected chairman of the Owan West Council of Edo State, Mr. Frank Ilaboya over his success at the polls. Ilaboya, who is a member of the Guild, got the overwhelming majority in the council polls held last weekend. Speaking yesterday in Lagos, Guild of Sports Editors’ President, Mr. Tony Ubani said Owan West Council constituents knew what they wanted hence they went for an upright candidate like Ilaboya, adding, “It is not by accident that Mr. Ilaboya has always been sought after for big positions. “He acquitted himself so well as chairman of Lagos SWAN that he was compelled to do a second term even when there were other people angling for the same position. “This is a man who touched so many people during his tenure as SWAN chairman that Lagos State had to conscript him into their football association board. He was elected as Edo FA chairman so easily, so it is not a surprise that he is now chairman of such an important Edo council as Owan West,” he said. Ubani urged Ilaboya to be steadfast in the discharge of his duties, positing that a sterling performance in this position would pave the way for higher positions for him. He praised Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki for being blessed with bright young minds, who are always eager to contribute to the development of the state, saying, “In Ilaboya, Governor Obaseki has a soulmate, who is ready to deliver the dividends of democracy to his people at the grassroots. “We are rest assured that Ilaboya will transform Owan West to a model council area.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
