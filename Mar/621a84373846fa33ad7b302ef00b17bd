The rainstorm has also thrown the entire community into total darkness following the damage done to electricity supply to the community.

He said that the community was in dire need of the help of government saying that the damage done is enormous that the people of the community could bear. Also speaking, the Public Relations Officer of the town, Mr Lawal Lukuman, said the torrential rainfall destroyed many houses seeking the support of the Osun state government to rebuild some affected buildings and area in the town. According to him :‘’We appeal to the state government and local government to come to our rescue to rebuild the affected places.Some of the owners of the houses cannot afford to buy nails or roofing sheet let alone buy materials to renovate the weak structures.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
