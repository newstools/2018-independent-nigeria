Lagos – Ike Shoronmu, the former Super Eagles goalkeeper, has thrown his weight behind the inclusion of Ikechukwu Ezenwa and erstwhile number one goalkeeper, Vincent Enyeama in the Super Eagles team for the World Cup. Shorunmu exclusively spoke to DAILY INDEPENDENT on Tuesday, while responding to a statement credited to Gernot Rohr that suggested that the World Cup door was shut against Enyeama. The Franco-German tactician, while recently answering a question on the possibility of inviting Enyeama to the national team, was quoted as saying that he could not continue to tinker with the national team and bringing in players when those in the team were good and willing to play. Shorunmu noted that Enyeama’s recall would have been invaluable to the team given that he had a lot of experiences behind him. But the former Super Eagles goalkeeper, however, said that the decision of the coach on Ezenwa or any other goalkeeper must be respected. “Experience wise, Enyeama would have been a better option because his experience at that level (World Cup) would have been invaluable. But if the coach has settled for Ezenwa or any other goalkeeper, we have to respect that. “I will always tell people that there is nothing like a coach having confidence in a player and once that is done, the player will be rest assured and he will give his best. So we must respect Rohr on his decision, but like I said, Enyeama is full of experience and would have brought it to the team,” Shorunmu said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
