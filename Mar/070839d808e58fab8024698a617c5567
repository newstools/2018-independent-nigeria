Kano State House of Assembly on Monday commenced a process to amend the state law that provided pension and gratuity for former governors and deputy governors. The decision to commence the amendment of the law followed a motion of urgent public importance raised before the legislature by Labaran Madari (APC), representing Warawa Constituency. According to Madari, the amendment of the law is to reduce unnecessary spending of public funds through payments to former governors and deputy governors who are also holding political offices after their tenures. Madari said the decision to review the existing law was to suspend such payments pending when the person would no longer hold any other political office. The member also said that any deputy governor the later became governor due to any reason would forfeit their pension as deputy governor. He said that the decision was necessary due to economic issues caused by the over-dependence on crude oil by past administrations. “As representatives of the people, it is our responsibility to find ways to reduce the burden on government so as to enable it execute projects that are of benefit to the general public,” the legislator said. The assembly members at a plenary presided by Abdullahi Ata, the speaker, suggested the creation of an ad-hoc committee to handle the issue. They set up an ad-hoc committee led by Kabiru Hassan-Dashi, the Majority Whip, and gave it two weeks to submit its report. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
