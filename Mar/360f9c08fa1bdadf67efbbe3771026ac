Nnewi – The newly appointed Acting Vice-Chancellor of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University (COOU), Anambra State, Prof. Gregory Chukwudi Nwakoby has warned that on no account should the academic excellence and standard already institutionalized in the institution be compromised. He noted that one way of maintaining the existing standards and possibly improve on it is by ensuring that students who pass through the university are well groomed with certificates earned by sheer dint of hard work just as staff remain disciplined. Nwakoby, who was appointed by Governor Willie Obiano, spoke to newsmen on Wednesday in his office at Igbariam campus as take over the administration of the university from the out-going VC, Prof. Fidelis Okafor. Assuring that he would also work towards improving the existing facilities on the ground, Nwakoby promised to accord the deserved rights to all and urged the staff to reciprocate the good gesture by being reasonable and focused in the collective drive to attain excellence. “I know that disputes and differences are natural among community of humans but such disputes must be reasonable enough and when they come, I will handle them as an expert in dialogue and crisis management”. “Governor Obiano has invested a lot of resources here but we want more facilities like faculty buildings, classrooms, hostels and more of such and my primary duty here is to ensure that the existing facilities on the ground are improved upon, apart from maintaining a quality standard of education and discipline,” he assured. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
