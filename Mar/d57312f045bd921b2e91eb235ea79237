A French police officer who exchanged himself for a hostage during a siege at a supermarket in southwestern France died overnight, officials said Saturday. Gendarme Lieutenant Colonel Arnaud Beltrame, 45, was shot in the supermarket in the town of Trèbes on Friday after taking the place of a female hostage. The attacker also killed two other people at the market and killed another person earlier in the day while stealing a car in Carcassone. French police killed the attacker, identified as Redouane Lakdim, on Friday. Lakdim had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, and prosecutors are treating the case as terrorism. Authorities arrested a woman who “shared the life” of Lakdim, prosecutor François Molins told reporters. On Saturday, authorities said they arrested a second person, a minor, who was a friend of the attacker. French President Emmanuel Macron said Beltrame had “fallen as a hero,” adding in a statement to French media that the gendarme had shown “exceptional courage and self-sacrifice.” Beltrame “died for his country,” tweeted Interior Minister Gérard Collomb on Saturday. “Never will France forget his heroism, his bravery, his sacrifice.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
