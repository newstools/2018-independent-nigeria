Lagos – In a move to put break the jinx surrounding their opening fixtures at the World Cup, Croatia coach, Zlatko Dalic, said he already has the list of players that will play Nigeria in Russia. The Croats have lost their last four opening fixtures at the World Cup and seek a stop to the poor run when they play Super Eagles on June 16 in Kaliningrad Dalic said on Tuesday that he already has in mind the starting 11 for the opening Group D match but will keep it secret. “I have the first 11 that will play Super Eagles in Kaliningrad but of course I will not disclose it because the whole structure still depends on form and injury. “It is better to know three months before the start of the World Cup and not close to the game.” It would be recalled that Croatia had to squeeze through the playoffs for the second straight FIFA World Cup despite having at its disposal a generation of players capable of making the difference. Led by playmaker, Luka Modric alongside Mario Mandzukic, Ivan Rakitic and Ivan Perisic, Croatia is a tough team to beat. Nigeria, Croatia, Iceland and Argentina would do battle in Group D to qualify for the second round of the tournament in Russia. Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has said that the opening match against Croatia was very vital to Nigeria’s chances of going far at the World Cup as anything short of victory might affect the chances of the team. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
