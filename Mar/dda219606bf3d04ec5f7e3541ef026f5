Antonio Conte appears to moving closer to the Chelsea exit door at the end of the season after his representatives opened talks with Paris Saint-Germain, who themselves are expected to give Unai Emery the boot, The Guardian claims. The Ligue 1 leaders will win the French title at a canter this season, currently 17 points clear at the top, but failure to progress past the round of 16 in the Champions League will cost Emery his job, and the same could be said of Conte at Chelsea. The Italian’s relationship with the Blues board has been fractious for some time and with the club underperforming in the league and now also out of Europe, his position seems all but untenable. PSG have been monitoring the situation for some time, keen to make a marquee managerial appointment following the respective reigns of Laurent Blanc and Emery. The other names on the list of managers that the Parisian club want to sound out are reportedly Jose Mourinho, Diego Simeone and Max Allegri, but it’s Conte that would perhaps be the easiest to convince at this point in time. The report claims that the talks were positive, with PSG able to offer Conte a pay rise, and all parties may well be open to an agreement, with the former Juventus boss likely to receive significantly more backing in the transfer market to boot. 2 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
