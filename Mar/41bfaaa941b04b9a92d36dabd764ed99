Lagos – Despite impressive earnings releases, the two-week long bullish performance in the local bourse came to a halt last week as the All Share Index ( ASI) plunged 2.9 per cent week-on-week to settle at 41,935.90 points, while year-to-date return declined to 9.7 per cent. A total turnover of 2.444 billion shares worth N36.665 billion in 26,712 deals were traded last week by investors on the floor of the Exchange in contrast to a total of 3.079 billion shares valued at N39.990 billion that exchanged hands in the previous week in 23,086 deals. The bearish performance was largely due to sell pressures in bellwethers in the banking and consumer goods sectors – Zenith Bank, Nestle Nigeria, Guaranty Trust Bank- which all released impressive results for full year 2017. As a result, investors lost N506.0 billion in value as market capitalisation fell to N15.0 trillion. Similarly, activity level softened as average daily volume and value traded declined 26.2 per cent and 20.5 per cent week-on-week to 408.5 million units and N6.3 billion respectively. The local bourse unexpectedly traded southwards on all days, but Tuesday when it closed the day flattish (ASI rose 0.4 %). The market began the week bearish, shedding 0.26 per cent largely due to sell offs in United Bank for Africa, Union Bank Nigeria and Unilever Nigeria. By Tuesday, optimism for a positive performance strengthened following a marginal rebound in the ASI (driven broadly by price appreciation in Dangote Cement) and the release of an impressive full year 2017 result by Zenith Bank. Surprisingly, there has been a lag in expected reaction as the ASI fell 0.5 per cent, 1.5 per cent and 0.6 per cent in the remaining days of the week, dragged by losses in banking and consumer goods counters – Zenith Bank, Guaranty Trust Bank, Nestle Nigeria and Dangote Sugar Refinery. Performance across sectors was largely negative as all indices closed in the red save the insurance index, which inched 0.3% higher on the back gains in NEM  Insurance (+11.6%), and Mansard Insurance (+3.8%). The banking index led laggards, down 8.4 per cent dragged by profit taking in United Bank for Africa (-13.6%), Zenith Bank (-10.7%) and Access Bank (-10.4%). The oil & gas and consumer goods indices trailed, shedding 1.6 per cent apiece as investors sold off positions in Conoil (-5.1%), Seplat Petroleum Development (-3.2%), Unilever Nigeria (-14.5%) and Dangote Sugar Refinery (-7.1%). 0 comments
