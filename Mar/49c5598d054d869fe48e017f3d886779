Lagos – Nigeria’s inflation rate extended the deceleration it started in February 2017 to the thirteenth consecutive month, just as Nigeria’s total national debt grew to N21.7 trillion ($70.92 billion) at the end of December 2017. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Wednesday said the country’s inflation rate for the end of February 2018 increased by 14.33 percent less than the 15.13 percent increase in January. However, Patience Oniha, Director-General of Debt Management Office (DMO) told a news briefing on Wednesday that the country’s debt figures stood at N17.36 trillion at the end of 2016, while Nigeria’s first Eurobond will be repaid when it matures in July. She added that the national debt mix is about 30 percent foreign and 70 percent local after a $2.5 billion Eurobond sale in February. Earlier this month, Nigeria paid off about N130 billion worth of treasury bills maturing this week instead of rolling over the debt as it has done in the past. Nigeria is trying to increase its ratio of foreign, dollar-serviced debt to local debt, in a bid to lower costs. Eurobond sales last year boosted foreign reserves by $4.8 billion, in addition to February’s $2.5 billion gain, Oniha said. With the new inflation figures, the country’s annual inflation rate fell to its lowest level in almost a year and slowed for the 13th month in a row, according to the NBS, which said the development was led by decelerating food prices as food inflation declined to 17.59 percent (0.85% m-o-m) from 18.92 percent. However, core inflation rose to 11.7 percent (0.75% m-o-m) from 11.1 percent. According to NBS, the percentage change in the average composite CPI for the twelve-month period ending February 2018 over the average of the CPI for the previous twelve month period was 15.93 percent, showing 0.29 percent point lower from 16.22 percent recorded in January 2018. On a month-on-month basis, the headline index increased by 0.79 percent in February 2018, down by 0.01 percent points from the rate recorded in January. However, the food index increased by 17.59 percent (year-on-year) in February, down by 1.33 percent points from rate recorded in January 2018 (18.92 percent). All major indexes increased during the month under review. The data indicate that price movements recorded by all items less farm produce or core sub-index increased by 11.7 percent (year-on-year) in February 2018, down by 0.4 percent points from the rate recorded in January (12.10 percent). NBS stated that the highest increases were seen in prices of fuel and lubricants for personal transport equipment, maintenance and repair of personal transport equipment, narcotics, vehicle spare parts, passenger transport by air, clearing, repair and hire of clothing, hospital services, domestic services and household services and glassware, tableware and household utensils, during the month. Meanwhile, the urban inflation rate rose by 14.76 percent (year-on-year) in February 2018 from 15.56 percent recorded in January, while the rural inflation rate also eased by 13.96 percent in February 2018 from 14.76 percent in January. On a month-on-month basis, the urban index rose by 0.82 percent in February 2018, down by 0.01 from 0.83 percent recorded in January, while the rural index also rose by 0.77 percent in February 2018, showing no difference with the rate recorded in January, NBS said. Analysts as Cordros Capital, while reacting to the new figures, said the continued drop in inflation rate and reduced supply of debt instruments will continue to drive fixed income yields southward, both in the primary and secondary markets. “That said, we understand the monetary authority is still largely mindful of foreign portfolio investors, hence the likelihood of continued OMO auction by the CBN to keep yields at relatively attractive levels that support healthy portfolio flows. “While we do not foresee a direct impact (Q4-17 earnings releases will shape appetite) of the latest data on activities in the equities market, we are not quick to rule out the possible reversal of flows into risky assets, from fixed income holdings, as return-hungry investors are enticed by lofty gains in the equities space”, Cordros Capital analysts said. Looking ahead, analysts at United Capital projected March 2018 inflation rate to decelerate faster, to 13.3 percent. “Month-on-month inflation is anticipated to remain around 0.8 percent, underpinned by a sustained pullback in food inflation, thanks to base effects from 2017, and continued stability in the FX market. Accordingly, we reiterate our view that inflation rate should come below the CBN’s target of 12 percent before Jun-18, further supporting the argument for a near-term rate cut. “While the possibility of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting next week for its March meeting remains unclear, the CBN is expected to hold rates unchanged in the interim. However, we expect the market yields to ease further, albeit marginally”, the analysts said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
