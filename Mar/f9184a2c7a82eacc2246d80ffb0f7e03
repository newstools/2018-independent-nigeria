Simon Mulongo, Deputy Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission for Somalia, appealed to all troop and police contributing countries to take into consideration gender parity while sending personnel to the mission. Mulongo called for closer working relations between female and male peacekeepers to enable the mission to achieve its mandate of eradicating terrorism in Somalia. He lauded the women for their contribution to the mission and reiterated AMISOM commitment to ensure gender parity. There are 850 women currently serving under AMISOM, making it one of the missions with the highest number of female peacekeepers in the world. The AU mission said there are plans to increase the number of women to help speed up the stabilization process ahead of Somaliaâ€™s 2020 to 2021 one-person, one-vote elections. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
