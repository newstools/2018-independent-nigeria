Lionel Messi has acknowledged that this summer’s World Cup finals could be the last chance for him and his international teammates to write their name in Argentina folklore.
As the days tick down to Russia 2018, the 30-year-old is now desperate to go one better with this talented crop of La Albiceleste players.
“I have seen everywhere how many people want it to also be a good World Cup for me, that there is a desire to see me win it,” he told La Cornisa. “The truth is that it has struck me, that in any part of the world they are waiting for Argentina to become the champions and for it to be given to me, it is impressive.
The Barcelona forward has been heralded as the greatest player of all time in the eyes of many, having won countless team honours at Camp Nou and five Ballon d’Or crowns on a personal level.
International silverware has so far eluded Messi, though as Argentina have finished runners-up in the Copa America on three occasions and also lost to Germany in the 2014 World Cup final.
Argentina are viewed as fifth favourites to go all the way by the bookies, behind holders Germany, Brazil, France and Spain. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
