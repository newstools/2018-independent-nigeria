An 18-year-old U.S. waitress’ kind act gained her a 16000-U.S.-dollar unexpected scholarship to Texas Southern University. The heroin Evoni Williams has reportedly been working full-time to earn money for further study in a restaurant in La Marque, Texas, the U. S. Williams helped an old man named Adrian Charpentier asked for help to chop his ham because his hands were deprived of strength by some illness. In that busy morning when she had loads of work on shoulder, Williams helped the man without hesitation. The moment she was leaning over the counter and cutting the ham was captured by a patron known as Laura Wolf who was sitting behind Charpentier. Wolf posted the picture on the facebook and wrote, “I’m thankful to have seen this act of kindness and caring at the start of my day while everything in this world seems so negative. If we could all be like this waitress & take time to offer a helping hand … ” According to local reports, Wolf didn’t know Williams, neither did Williams know her act was shot and shared on the web. However, the small act of kindness soon accumulated its own power on and outside the internet. `We wanted to reward Evoni’s act of kindness and let her know that good deeds do not go unnoticed,” Melinda Spaulding, an administrator at Texas Southern University was quoted by CNN as saying. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
