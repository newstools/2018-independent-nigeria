The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has dismissed a German doctor’s case against his conviction in a French Court for drugging and killing his stepdaughter in Germany. A French court sentenced Dieter Krombach to 15 years in prison in 2011 for assault leading to the death of 14-year-old Kalinka Bamberski in 1982. The Paris Assizes court found that Krombach, intending to sexually assault the teen, gave her a sedative and an injection after which she died. The judgment was upheld on appeal in 2012. Krombach had found himself in the custody of French authorities in 2009 after being kidnapped by persons paid by the girl’s father, Andre Bamberski. A native of Bavaria, Krombach was found tied up and gagged on a street in Mulhouse, France, in October 2009. Authorities arrested him and proceeded to trial. German prosecutors had on four previous occasions declined to put Krombach on trial, citing a lack of evidence. Krombach argued that being tried in France, after the judicial proceedings against him in Germany, violated his right not to be tried twice for the same offence. On Thursday, the ECHR dismissed Krombach’s claim that the trial in France breached his right under the European Convention on Human Rights not to be tried twice for the same offence. That right only applied to proceedings in courts in the same state, the ECHR ruled. “I am satisfied today, but it’s not right that I should have been under psychological stress for four years,’’ Andre Kamberski told dpa.  1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
