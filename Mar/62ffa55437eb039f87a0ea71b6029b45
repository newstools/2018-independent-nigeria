Lagos – Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles Technical Adviser, believes that it is a good thing to dream to win the World Cup but that one must be realistic. The coach, who said this on Friday in Lagos during the World Cup Trophy Tour event that held at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, informed that the country was ranked 52 in the world. “It is good to dream to bring the World Cup, but we must be realistic. We are number 52 in the world,” he said. Rather than continue to dream on winning the trophy, the coach is praying for injury free players ahead of the tournament that will kick off this June in Russia. “Hope no injuries,” he said, adding that Carl Ikeme is still fighting for his life. The coach expresses confidence in the team’s preparation saying that it was a good one. “We have two friendlies in March, two other in June. We will start our final preparation for the World cup in Nigeria because it is good for the team to say goodbye to their people.” Amaju Pinnick, President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), who spoke before the coach, has reiterated his belief that the Super Eagles have what it takes to win the summer World Cup in Russia. “We believe we can win the World Cup with the likes of Victor Moses, Alex Iwobi, Kelechi Iheanacho,” Pinnicksaid. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
