Who the cap fits, let him wear it! The cap that fits these men is not just the position they occupy but also the fashionable caps they wear. In no particular order, Oyo State governor, Abiola Ajimobi; former Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Emeka Ihedioha CON; Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Ogun State Governor, Ibikunle Amosun and Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola – YAYI, have unique traditional attire caps that are now their style identity. Leading the pack is Ogun State governor, Ibikunle Amosun with his ever pointed cap. Like some Yoruba natives would say ‘cap always looking up to heaven’. If you were observant, you would have noticed that former Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Emeka Ihedioha wears green cap with every outfit. This got him the nickname, ‘the man with a green cap in a red chamber’. The one and only, most respected APC leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has rocked his specially engraved, sideways facing, number eight caps for years. No one else wears anything close to it. It has so often been said that the oval shaped eight on the cap match his glasses; a sure way of slaying effortlessly. Oyo State governor, Abiola Ajimobi, made the cut with his side bent cap. It is usually bent to his right side and his caps always have unique designs. Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola – YAYI always keeps us star struck with his striped patterned caps. It is either the zebra colour or just stripes that stand out. These very influential men do not have time to talk fashion, but they are style conscious nonetheless. They keep it simple but savvy. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
