Lagos – The Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) has approved the replacement of the trophies presented to both the men and women Africa Footballers of the Year winners. This is part of the resolutions of the continental body during its Executive Committee meeting which took place in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, on September 29. The decision of CAF, according to a release on its website, was borne out of the need to make the awards and their trophies look different from what they used to be, noting that even previous winners of the individual awards would be presented with the new trophy at the next CAF award ceremony. “Following the recognition of the diversity of trophies for the same award, a new trophy for the African Player of the Year has been adopted. “The Women’s Player of the Year will also receive a new trophy. Meanwhile, all previous winners will receive the new trophy at the next CAF Awards ceremony.” CAF also approved a proposal for the appointment a new auditing body. After a call for tenders for the appointment of a new auditor, ‘Ernst & Young’ was selected. The proposal was submitted to the Extraordinary General Assembly on September 30, 2018 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. SHOCKING STORY!!!
