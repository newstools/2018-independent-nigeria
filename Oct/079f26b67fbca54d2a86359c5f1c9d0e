ABUJA – Members of the House of Representatives on Wednesday called the attention of the Federal Government and relevant agencies to the suffering of flood victims in 13 different communities in Rivers State. The affected communities are all located in Ahoada-West/Egbema/Ndoni/Ogba Federal Constituency in Rivers State where life is said to have ground to a halt due to incessant flooding in the area. Consequently, the House while ruling in a motion under matters of urgent public importance brought by Uchechukwu Nnam-Obi (PDP, Rivers), directed its Committee on Environment to liaise with relevant government agencies to bring succour to the affected communities. In the motion entitled: “Urgent need to address the plight of the communities sacked by flood in Ahoada-West/Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Federal Constituency”, the House asked the committee to link up with the National Inland Waterways Management Agency (NIWA) and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to mitigate the flooding, as well as seek palliative measures to cater to the displaced in camps. Nnam-Obi, while presenting the motion, said: “The devastating effects of flood in  Ahoada-West/Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Federal Constituency in Rivers State has wreaked havoc in several communities. “The persistent seasonal rainfall of this year has wreaked untold havoc on coastal areas and river basin communities particularly in Rivers and Bayelsa states are currently experiencing flooding due to the rise in sea level and tidal surge in the above communities. “The devastating flood has ravaged crops, farmlands, dwelling homes and submerged worship places, schools in these communities while businesses and social life in the areas are at abeyance. “The rains are still cascading torrents in these communities and the situation is creating a very serious humanitarian crisis as more families at rendered homeless and their means of livelihood destroyed by flood. “The health and sanitary conditions in the IDP camps have become very unbearable and deadly if urgent mitigative measures are not taken”, he said.
