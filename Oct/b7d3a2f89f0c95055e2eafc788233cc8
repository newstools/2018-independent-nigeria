ASABA – Crisis has again engulfed the All Progressives Congress (APC), Governorship primary in Delta State. Prof. Pat Utomi and Hon. Victor Ochei, two governorship aspirants of the party in the state, have called for a postponement of the party governorship primary while Dr. Ibe Kachikwu and ex-Gov Emmanuel Uduaghan were present at the meeting where the decision was taken. Utomi described the process of the primary as illegitimate, adding that the delegates list was unavailable for the aspirants. He said at a meeting between critical stakeholders, three of the aspirants suggested a postponement due to the shortcomings that have plagued the shadow polls. Utomi said, “The delegates list is not available, aspirants have not seen the list. I believe only those who drew up the list have it. The list should have been made available to all at least three days to the primary to enable aspirants make their pitch to them. “There is no level playing field for all aspirants. This will create a crisis of legitimacy. We have suggested that the primary be postponed, that way we will have a truly democratic process,” he said. SHOCKING STORY!!!
