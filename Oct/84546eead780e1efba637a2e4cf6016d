Abuja – The All Progressives Congress (APC) has dismissed as mere propaganda the accusations that leaders of the party in Akwa Ibom are plotting a reign of terror with the aim to postpone the 2019 governorship election in the state. The opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had at the weekend alleged that former governor of the State Senator Godswill Akpabio is spearheading APC’s violent takeover of the state, all geared to stop the 2019 poll. But APC in its reactions dismissed as another falsehood and propaganda stunt being orchestrated by the PDP in the face of imminent defeat in 2019. The party also claimed that the allegation is another PDP’s usual scheme of playing the victim when in fact, it is the aggressor. APC, in a statement by Yekini Nabena, Acting National Publicity of the party, said the propaganda will not in anyway hinder the ruling party from voting out the PDP government under Emmanuel Udom in 2019. APC claimed that it has enough resource in both chieftains and membership to uproot the PDP government in that state. SHOCKING STORY!!!
