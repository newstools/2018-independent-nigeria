Victor Moses is in strong contention to make Chelsea’s 18-man squad to face Bate as Hazard suffered an injury. Speaking to reporters at the pre-match press conference on Wednesday, manager, Maurizio Sarri, revealed that the Belgium international, Hazard, will not be available for selection due to a back injury. The Italian manager is now left with only three first team wingers in Victor Moses, Pedro and Willian and it is envisaged that the trio would be named in the 18-man squad for the match day three tie against the Belarusian team, with two expected to start and one on the substitutes bench. Moses’ hopes were increased when Sarri stated that he’s not sure if England U17 World Cup winning winger, Callum Hudson-Odoi, would make the squad. The former Nigeria international was in Chelsea’s squad against PAOK Salonika and Vidi FC but only tasted action against the Hungarian opponents. He was linked with a departure from the Stamford Bridge outfit in the hours leading up to the close of the summer transfer window, only for him to stay put at the club.
