Enugu – The All Progressive Congress (APC), Enugu State chapter, has said that the reappearance of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), would have no significant effect on the 2019 general election. It could be recalled that the IPOB leader went missing in September last year after the military invaded his home town in Abia State during the operation Python Dance. It was reported that the video which showed where the IPOB leader praying in Jerusalem surfaced online recently. Ben Nwoye, the state chairman of APC, stated this in an interview with our correspondent in Enugu on Thursday. He accused the IPOB leader of deceiving Igbo youths while causing the death of so many of them during the clashes between his supporters and soldiers involved in the military exercise. Nwoye, who described Kanu’s action as a deceit in an attempt to make money, called on Igbo leaders to educate the youths on why they should not support his selfish motive. He said: “Namadi Kanu is inconsequential, his language of speech is inconsequential and he has no effect in the political atmosphere of Nigeria. Why did he run away thereby causing the death of innocent citizens? He is only pursuing his selfish interest in the name of seeking his own sovereign nation. “It’s unfortunate that he disappeared  to enjoy himself somewhere, and now he is sending message that Igbo people shouldn’t participate in the general election, when Igbo people are looking forward in leading the nation in 2023. “I want to advise the people to ignore him and see his statement as someone who is a dreamer. It is incumbent upon the elders of Igbo land to inform the youth that the man is a deceit because those that have being killed cannot come back,” Nwoye said.
