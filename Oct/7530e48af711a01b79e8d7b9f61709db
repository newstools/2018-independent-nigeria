Audu Adedolapo Lagos – Nigeria have moved up four steps to 44 on the recent FIFA Rankings released on Thursday. The upward move came on the heel of the back-to-back victories recorded over Libya in their 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying series. Nigeria, who defeated Libya 4-0 in Uyo and 3-2 in Sfax, Tunisia, mustered 1431 points, up from 1415 points recorded last month. Nigeria are, however, the third best team in Africa with Tunisia being the continent’s most ranked team at 22. Tunisia is followed by Senegal on 25 globally while Congo DR, two stps below Nigeria on FIFA ranking are the fourth best African side. Morocco (47), Cameroon (51) Ghana (52) and Egypt (58) placed 5th-8th in the continent. Cote d’ Ivoire (64) and Guines (65) are the other African teams that made 9th and 10th. However, on the world stage, Belgium upstaged France at the top by the narrowest possible margin – 1733 ranking points to Les Bleus’ 1732. The top two remain out in front after a month in which each of them enjoyed a win and a draw, with Belgium and France beating Switzerland (8th, unchanged) and Germany (14th, down two) respectively in the UEFA Nations League and emerging with honours even from matches against the Netherlands (15th, up 2) and Iceland (36th, unchanged) respectively. The Dutch, meanwhile, have risen on the back of a fine 3-0 Nations League win over their struggling German rivals, and other sides have also profited from success in the same competition. England (5th, up 1), for example, have swapped places with Uruguay (6th, down 1) after winning 3-2 away to Spain (9th, unchanged), while Norway (48th, up 4) have moved into the top 50 after back-to-back victories, and Russia (41st, up 5) have also maintained their recent momentum by staying top of Group 2. Super Falcons remain at the top spot as the highest ranked African team. The Super Falcons are ranked 38th in the World which Ranking list was released September 28, 2018 but leaves them 9 places above the next ranked African team Ghana.
