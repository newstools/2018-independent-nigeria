SEGUN OLANIYAN KATSINA – Following the security situation in Borno State, the 2018 Batch ‘C’ National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members deployed to serve in the state have been relocated to Katsina State where they will observe their three-week orientation course. Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno state, while addressing the corp members at the swearing-in ceremony held at the temporary camp at the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) Training College in Katsina on Thursday, said their relocation was due to the temporary security situation in his state, appealing to the corps members to re-dedicate themselves to nation building. Shettima, represented by Mahdi Gazali, the state Chairman, NYSC Governing Board, however, noted that the state government was doing everything possible, through its programme of reconstruction and rehabilitation, to return the state on the path of peace and development. “I therefore wish to assure you of your safety during the three weeks orientation exercise and the service ahead. It behoves on you to be part of the problem solving team by expressing your potentials through rendering honest and dedicated services to your host communities”, he said. “I urge you to summon courage to come and stay in Borno and you will understand the fact that the security situation of the state is not bad as it is being propagated by some media,” the governor added. Rabiu Aminu, the Borno State NYSC Coordinator on his part, said 1,350 corps members were posted to the state, appealing to them to exhibit high level of respect and discipline during the camping period. While commending the state government for providing remedies to the operational challenges confronting the scheme in the state, the state NYSC boss urged the corps members to be security conscious, as the issues of security rest on not only the security personnel alone but the entire citizenry.
