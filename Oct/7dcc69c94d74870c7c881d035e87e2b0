Deputy President of the Senate Ike Ekweremadu has expressed grief over the demise of former Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Board of Trustees, Chief Tony Anenih. Ekweremadu in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Uche Anichukwu described Anenih, who died at 85, as a pan-Nigerian and patriot. He said: “Chief Anineh contributed so much to deepening our democracy and setting the nation on the path of progress at the end of many decades of military rule. “He was a humble leader, fine public administrator, political kingmaker, a colossus, master strategist, and a political oracle, who was very vast in political engineering. “Iyasele was a courageous man, and a man of few words, who meant whatever he said and said only what he meant. He will be sorely missed.” Similarly, the Chairman South East Governors Forum, Gov. David Umahi of Ebonyi, expressed sadness over the death of Anenih. Umahi, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Emmanuel Uzor described Anenih as not just a patriot but a political encyclopedia, a man who contributed immensely to the development of democracy in Nigeria. He said Nigeria has lost a great icon and a foremost politician, whose love and contribution towards the sustenance of democracy was total and unequalled. Umahi added that Nigeria, Edo state and the PDP have lost a great icon.
