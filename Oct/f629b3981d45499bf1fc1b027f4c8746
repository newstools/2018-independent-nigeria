Sensational singer Mayeth, has been making major moves to stage a big comeback to the music scene and one of the moves is the release of her new single, entitled “Don’t Play.“ The Delta state-born singer, originally named Mayeth Uzefe Isaac, does different music genres which make her move in a slightly different direction and with her distinct voice and style which was first discovered at a church convention at the age of 10. Mayeth began her journey into stardom at the age of 15 from a family of singers and songwriters, the likes of Jimoh Waxiu and Kellylyon. She is one of the reformation happening in the entertainment industry today, and with her new release, ‘Don’t Play,’ which is an infusion of HipHop and Dancehall vibe, she has continued honing her skills to master a unique that comfortably allows her infuse every other genre to her style of HipHop. She held down the sustain pedal, as she pleaded with one word: “Don’t – Don’t – Don’t Play With My Heart,’ there her awakening began; Mayeth allowed tones to ring out indefinitely, creating catchy and groovy melodies. Giving it her 101%, the breakout banger had a well-established connection between Mayeth and Galaxy Beat (‘the producer’), the song is busy, tastefully created, meditative and circled under the spell of Nigerian music. Mayeth made it overtly-romantic, as she sings her melodies meld together, shifting in vibes and volume. “Don’t Play” draws on reiteration and also a certain degree of impromptu inspiration.
