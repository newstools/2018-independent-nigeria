Scotland confirmed a case of mad cow disease Thursday but authorities are unsure whether the animal developed the illness in a one-off genetic mutation, or whether a more worrying underlying factor such as contaminated food was involved. Scottish government spokesman Luke Boddice said a four-year-old cow had died on a farm in Aberdeenshire, in the north-east of the country, and authorities discovered that it had contracted mad cow disease after a routine check. “We are chasing its cohorts and will be destroying them in line with EU regulation in the coming days,” Boddice said, referring to other cows in the vicinity. Also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, mad cow disease is an incurable disease that wastes the brains and nervous systems of infected cattle, causing muscular twitching or even frenzy. Scientists also believe that humans who eat BSE-infected meat can contract Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD), a fatal brain disease. Britain was the epicenter of a mad cow disease outbreak during the 1980s and 1990s, which led to a Continent-wide food-safety crisis and, eventually, to the creation of the European Food Safety Authority in 2002.
