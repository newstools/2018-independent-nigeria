Lagos – The downturn in the domestic market continued into the second week of Q4:2018, thereby raising more questions regarding the timeframe for the end of the current weak performance. Nevertheless, performance of the local bourse was mixed this week as the benchmark index advanced on three of five trading days. The NSE All Share Index (ASI) opened the week in the green, appreciating 0.2 per cent on Monday, before declining by 0.1 per cent on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively as investors took profit in previous gainers. However, the bearish run was halted on Thursday as the ASI increased 0.1 per cent and this was sustained till Friday (+0.1 per cent). Consequently, the index advanced 0.2 per cent week-on-week (W-o-W) to 32,456.98 points while year-to-date (YTD) loss improved to –15.1 per cent. Similarly, market capitalisation rose N27bn to settle at N11.8trn. Activity level strengthened as average volume and value traded rose 14.5 per cent and 0.3 per cent to settle at 182.9 million units and N2bn, respectively. The top traded stocks by volume were Royal Exchange (233.5m units), Guaranty Trust Bank (94.7m units) and FCMB (77.0m units) while Guaranty Trust Bank (N3.5bn), Nestle Nigeria (N698.1m) and Dangote Cement (N683.3m) were the top traded stocks by value. Performance across sectors was mixed last week as two indices advanced while three declined.  The banking index improved the most, up 0.8 per cent W-o-W as investors took position in Zenith Bank and Guaranty Trust Bank while the industrial goods index gained 0.3 per cent W-o-W. On the flipside, the insurance index depreciated the most, falling 1.7 per cent W-o-W as profit taking in Mansard Insurance dragged the index. Similarly, the oil & gas and consumer goods indices declined W-o-W following losses in Oando and Nigerian Breweries, respectively. Investor sentiment softened in the week as market breadth (gainers/losers’ ratio), reduced to 0.8x from 0.9x in the prior week as 29 stocks advanced while 37 declined. The best performing stocks for the week were Wema Bank (+17.9 per cent), Chemical and Allied Products and Mutual Benefit (+11.5 per cent) while First Aluminium, Cutix and John Holt were the worst performing stocks.
