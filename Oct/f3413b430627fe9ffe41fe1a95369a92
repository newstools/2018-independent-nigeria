Super Eagles target in their 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Libya is winning the two legged games. This assurance was given by the team’s defender, Kenneth Omeruo, on Monday. He said that Super Eagles would strive to pick the six points against Libya. “We will be up against a strong Libyan side but we are the Super Eagles and we have a great squad,” Omeruo told team official Twitter. “We will give our all to pick maximum six points from both games. “I have confidence in the crew. We urge all our fans to get behind us and give us all the support. We will not disappoint.” Nigeria will host Libya in Uyo on Saturday with the reverse fixture coming three days later in Tunis. Libya top the Group E of the qualifiers with four points on superior goal advantage over second placed South Africa also with four points. Libya beat Seychelles 5-1 in their group game opener before last month’s goalless stalemate against South Africa in Durban. The Super Eagles lost their group game opener 2-0 to South Africa 2-0 in Uyo before trouncing Seychelles 3-0 in Vitoria to put their campaign back on track. And the Leganes defender is upbeat the three-time African champions can, twice, run the rule over their north African counterparts. SHOCKING STORY!!!
