Lagos – The Super Eagles will be leaving Uyo for Sfax, Tunisia, today (Monday) for Tuesday’s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier between them and The Mediterranean Knights of Libya. DAILY INDEPENDENT can confirm that the team will depart early in the morning for the movement to Tunisia. Recall that the Super Eagles mauled The Knights of Libya 4-0 on Saturday to move to second spot on the qualifying Group E with South Africa now dictating the pace in the group after overcoming winless Seychelles 6-0 in Durban, also on Saturday. It has been gathered that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) deliberately allowed the players and coaches to have at least more than 24-hour rest after the victorious match, hence the decision to travel today. It was also learnt that the team was billed to travel to Abuja after the match but the authorities declined that in order to allow the players have enough rest before embarking on the journey to Tunisia. This development was also supposedly because of the rave reviews trailing the atmosphere in Uyo, as Eagles technical adviser, Gernot Rohr, and his players have been hailing the facilities and packages on offer. Rohr even stated categorically during one of his press conferences that he and his players are grateful to Akwa Ibom State governor, Emmanuel Udom, for according them a warm reception and making their stay very comfortable. Consequently, the Eagles will now stay two more nights at Ibom Hotel & Resort, while also perfecting their strategies at the practice pitch of Goidswill Akpabio International Stadium before they fly out to Sfax.
