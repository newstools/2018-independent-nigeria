YOLA – Over 50 youth organisations that campaigned for President Muhammadu Buhari’s election in 2015 have regrouped to ensure victory for Atiku Abubakar in 2019. The youths also advised President Buhari to put the national interest first before those of the powerful cabal around him by withdrawing his candidacy since he has not been able to fix the economy. The groups maintained that if President would drop his candidacy, Atiku would fix the ailing economy, tackle unemployment and security challenges bedeviling the nation. Comrade Adamu Babayola, the Adamawa State Coordinator of Atiku Abubakar Independent Volunteer Movement, in a statement issued on Monday, said the advice became necessary to save the president from the humiliation of defeat in the hands of Atiku. He stated: “All the youth organisations that campaigned for Buhari’s election in 2015 have regrouped to ensure Atiku’s victory, the youths have contacted my office and promised to mobilise support for Atiku come 2019. “The youths also advised President Buhari to heed the advice which former President Goodluck Jonathan rejected from well-wishers in 2015 to become a statesman. “The suffering of the masses has now compelled us to love Atiku more than Buhari. We are working for a landslide victory for Atiku. He will surely defeat Buhari just the same way and same convincing margin he beat the other aspirants in the PDP primaries in Port Harcourt. “As an international businessman and investor, Atiku can easily attract more foreign investors in manufacturing, agriculture and service sectors and only he has the courage and personality to tackle this insecurity that has proved to be beyond Buhari’s ability. “It will be more honorable for President Buhari to voluntarily withdraw from the race so Atiku can take over and fix the ailing economy. Nigeria is in serious economic crisis.” We need jobs. Only Atiku Abubakar can create jobs and revamp the national economy to avert a deeper crisis,” he said.
