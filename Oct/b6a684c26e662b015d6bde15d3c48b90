UMUAHIA – Senator Theodore Orji, the immediate-past governor of Abia State and Senator representing Abia Central, has expressed deep sorrow over the death of Chief Tony Anenih, Peoples Democracy Party’s (PDP’s) former Board of Trustees (BoT). Orji, in a statement made available to newsmen in Umuahia on Monday, maintained that the nation and democracy had lost one of its finest. He said that throughout Anenih’s time in politics, he never negated the principle of fairness, equity and justice, adding that these had remained the bastion on which every democracy that endured were hinged on. He added: “Here was a gentleman, who never leaves you with a false impression. He tells you the way it is and leaves you to make you decisions. He was totally selfless and unassuming and does not carry his importance on him at anytime. “At a time when I returned to my original home, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2010, he was one of those who made sure that things went well for me and my people. He was always calling to ask how things were working out and gave very valuable advice on the way forward.” Orji commiserated with the PDP, the government and people of Edo State and his immediate family, even as he prayed for the peaceful repose of his soul.
