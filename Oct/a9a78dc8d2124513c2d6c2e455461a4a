United Arab Emirates (AP) – Pakistan increased its lead to 281 runs in the second test Wednesday after seamer Mohammad Abbas ripped through Australia’s batting lineup with a five-wicket haul and the visitors were bowled out for 145. Fakhar Zaman (66) notched his second straight half century in his test debut as Pakistan smoothly reached 144-2 at stumps in their second innings. Azhar Ali survived an lbw television referral and returned to form with an unbeaten 54. Lefthander Haris Sohail, who was out first ball in the first innings, was not out on 17 at stumps. Zaman had dominated the Australian spin threat of Nathan Lyon until the offspinner took a blinder off his own bowling. The lefthander, who hit seven fours, drove powerfully but Lyon held on to a ferocious drive two-handedly in front of his face. Earlier, Australia conceded a massive 137-run lead as Abbas finished with career-best 5-33 when he had the last wicket of Mitchell Starc (34) lbw. Abbas had reduced Australia to 20-2 overnight after Pakistan recovered well to post 282 through identical knocks of 94 runs each by captain Sarfraz Ahmed and Zaman on the first day. SHOCKING STORY!!!
