The Nigeria Army has denied report that soldiers searching for missing Maj.-Gen. Idris Alkali (retd) shot and killed a 35-year old woman in Fwapa Doi, Jos, Plateau State. Deputy Director, Army Public Relations, Col. Kayode Ogunsanya, who debunked the report in a statement on Saturday in Jos, warned against fake news, saying it is “injurious to 3 Division, Nigeria Army, Rukuba”. Ogunsanya said that the Division’s headquarters “wish to state categorically that the report was a deliberate falsehood and an attempt to portray the division in bad light. “I wish to state that contrary to the report, the soldiers were in the Dura-Du District and its environs from Monday, 15th October – Wednesday, 17th October, 2018. “They were there to provide security to the sniffer dogs deployed to assist in locating the whereabouts of the missing retired senior officer, Major-General Idris Alkali, and not on Friday, 19th October 2018 as reported. “On completion of the mission, the troops and sniffer dogs returned to the barracks on Wednesday, 17th October, 2018. “The troops did not engage anyone in fire fight because the entire district has been deserted. “No soldier fired any shot. All the ammunitions were duly accounted for by the troops,” he explained. The spokesperson said that the report further insinuated that soldiers stopped people from accessing their homes, burgled their shops, ate their chickens and goats and ransack their homes. He stated the insinuation was untrue, pointing out that the headquarters had earlier advised residents who fled their homes and business premises to return. According to him, this is to avoid their homes and business premises from being broken into by miscreants. SHOCKING STORY!!!
