Owerri – Rochas Okorocha, Imo State Governor has taken exception to the remark of the Acting Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Malam Lanre Issa Onilu, who described him as a bad loser. Acting National Publicity Secretary, Malam Onilu had in a statement described some APC governors including Okorocha, as bad losers in respect of the governorship primaries of the party. But in a statement in Owerri, Sam Onwuemeodo, Chief Press Secretary to the Governor said that Okorocha and contrary to what Onilu would want people to believe, and other governors were rather partners-in-progress with the National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole. The governor noted that disagreements with the party leadership were bound to arise and advised the national publicity secretary on the need to exercise caution in order not to create wrong impression. He warned against castigating governors, who made the party thick from the outset, insisting that Onilu misfired by doing so and had sent a bad signal to the world. Okorocha advised Onilu to acquaint himself with proper information on the Imo APC case to avoid feeding the public with falsehood that might snowball into a conflagration. He recalled that Oshiomhole cancelled the results of the primary poll conducted by Ahmed Gulak-led committee and set up a new committee headed by Ibrahim Agbabiaka, which conducted fresh primary polls.
