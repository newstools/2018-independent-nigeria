LOKOJA – No fewer than 100,000 worshippers are expected to participate in a crusade slated for Wednesday in Lokoja, organised by the Deeper life Bible Church with the General Superintendent, Pastor Williams Kumuyi ministering. The Kogi state Overseer of the Deeper Life Bible Church, Pastor Raymond Egunjobi, who  disclosed this  at a press briefing, said all necessary arrangements  have been  made for success of the crusade Pastor Egunjobi, who described the third visit of Pastor Kumuyi to Kogi as a springboard that would usher in a new lease of life for the whole state, urged the people to attend the programme for divine solutions to their “insurmountable challenges”. “I crave your indulgence to go down memory lane to recall that during the 2016 crusade held at the same venue, many participants who got instant  miracles openly testified to the supernatural power of God that wrought miracles of healings with the dumb speaking, the deaf hearing and the blinds receiving their sights, ’he said. He expressed optimism that the crusade would witness greater supernatural blessings of salvation, healings, deliverance, prosperity and promotion, amongst others. The clergy man stated that the church was praying and also working in collaboration with the various security agencies in the state to ensure a hitch free programme. SHOCKING STORY!!!
