Imama Amapakabo has walked away from El Kanemi Warriors following the completion of his one-year contract with the NPFL club. The former Rangers International coach took charge at the Maiduguri based club a year after a disappointing NPFL title defence ended up with him getting the sack at the Flying Antelopes. His 12 months at Warriors saw him joggle roles, as he also served in that period as an assistant coach in the Super Eagles. “I signed a one year contract when I joined the club before the start of the season and right now the season is over,” the coach was quoted by SCORENigeria.com El Kanemi Warriors ended the 2017-2018 NPFL on the 13th position with 17 points. On Thursday, they exited the Federation Cup at the quarterfinal following a 1-0 defeat by Nasarawa United in Aba. SHOCKING STORY!!!
