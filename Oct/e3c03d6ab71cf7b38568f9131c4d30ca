Lagos – Thomas Dennerby, the Super Falcons head coach, has made it known that he is eyeing the 2018 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations (AWCN) title. The continental tournament will be hosted by Ghana between November 17 and December 1. The top three teams will qualify for the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup in France. Dennerby, who hails from Sweden, has since stated that he is keen to lead the Super Falcons to a record-extending ninth AWCN title. ‘’Before November 4, when we have to pick the final squad and send to CAF, we will have to select the players in best form,’’ Dennerby said while speaking to journalists. ‘’Of course as a head coach, you are always under pressure but I have been in this business for long and I am not so worried about that. ‘’We will be going for a shot at the title and with good solid preparations, we can win the title again,” he continued. ‘’We always go to a tournament to try to win it. I also know from the last tournament that other teams from Africa are really good. ‘’I know there are a lot of good teams hunting us. Anyway, in the end, we need to be one of the three best teams so that we qualify for the World Cup. We really need to go to the World Cup.’’ Nigeria are in Group B alongside South Africa, Kenya and Zambia.
