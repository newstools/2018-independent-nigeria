Iraqi forces continue their campaign against the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), targeting and dismantling at least 40 positions belonging to the extremist group in Diyala province. “Joint forces from the army, police, and the Hashd al-Shaabi militia launched a widespread military operation over the past days in eastern Diyala,” Anadolu Agency quoted Iraqi Police Captain Habib al-Shimari as saying on Saturday. The security operation resulted in the death of two ISIS militants, Shimari added without providing any numbers about Iraqi forces casualties. Despite Iraq declaring a “final victory” against the extremist group last December, IS continues to launch sporadic attacks, including bombings, assassinations, and kidnappings in previously liberated areas. On Thursday, the Kurdistan Region’s office for the rescue of abducted Yezidi (Ezidi) announced that two Ezidis had been recovered in Syria, years after they were kidnapped by IS militants in 2014. Ezidis were subjected to atrocities and mass executions at the hands of the extremist group for years after IS overran Shingal in mid-2014, forcing hundreds of thousands of the ethnoreligious minority to flee their homes. Others were not as lucky and remained stranded in the war zone. Earlier in the month, two operators, carried out over a three-day period from Oct. 6 to 9, resulted in the capture of 10 people suspected of being part of a key IS “financial facilitation group” in coordination with the Iraqi government. On Oct. 9, the Kurdistan Region’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) released footage of the joint operation with coalition forces where they arrested a significant group of IS financers. Stacks of money and weapons were confiscated during the raid. SHOCKING STORY!!!
