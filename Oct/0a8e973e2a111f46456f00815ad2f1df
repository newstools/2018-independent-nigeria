Lagos – There are strong indications that the leadership of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr may reconsider playing the last Nations Cup qualifier between Nigeria and Seychelles at ultra-modern Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that though the stadium was said to have been dropped on account of what had been deemed its ‘small size,’ feelers however from Wednesday’s Federation Cup final at the venue have raised fresh angles to the possibilities of Nigeria’s national team playing there. NFF president, Amaju Pinnick, during the just concluded Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the body in Asaba, was said to have asked Rohr to again check the feasibility of the stadium hosting his team. Should Rohr emerge with a positive venue from his checks and the Federation Cup final, Nigerians might see the Super Eagles line out against Seychelles in March next year at the stadium that hosted this year’s African Athletics Championship with great success and rave reviews following. The Super Eagles top Group E with nine points from four games with South Africa placed second with eight points. The Mediterranean Knights of Libya sits in third position with four points, while Seychelles have just one point.
