Lagos – Nigeria’s female national team, Super Falcons’ coach, Thomas Dennerby has ruled out underrating his teams’ opponents at the forthcoming Africa Women Cup of Nations (AWCON) following the draw conducted on Sunday night. Following Sunday night’s draw that placed the defending champions in Group B alongside South Africa, Kenya and Zambia, many pundits have tagged it an easy stroll into the semifinal for the Super Falcons. However, Dennerby has refrained from sharing the same sentiments, as he acknowledged that every other country would be in Ghana next month to pick Women World Cup tickets. Dennerby, though, acknowledged that the Super Falcons’ record would be a big challenge to meet up with, as all other competitors at Ghana 2018 will want to bring down the Nigerians and eventually stop their domination. “It is a good group and really have a good chance to win it even though we expect a tough game against South Africa. “We have a good idea of South Africa, but not much about Zambia and Kenya. We will try to analyse these teams and won’t underrate them.” Ghana head Group A in Accra and Nigeria top Group B in Cape Coast, which means both rivals can only clash in the knockout stage of the tournament. In Ghana’s group for the tournament, which will run from November 17 to December 1, are 2016 hosts, Cameroon as well as Algeria and Mali. Two teams will qualify from each group, but only the top three teams from the competition will fly Africa’s flag at the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup in France next June. Besides being defending champions, the Super Falcons are also the most successful team in the competition’s history, having won the tournament a record eight times.
