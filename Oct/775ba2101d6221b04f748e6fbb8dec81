Peter Rufai, former Super Eagles goalkeeper, believes Libya are no threat to Nigeria’s ambition of returning to the Africa Cup of Nations since winning it in 2013. Rufai insisted that after missing out on the 2015 and 2017 editions, the players were ready and hungry for a return. “As far as football is concerned globally, Libya is not a threat.” Reacting to Libya’s national team coach, Adel Amrouche’s comment that Nigeria would be easier to play than South Africa, Rufai said: “Even if they get the best coach from Brazil or Germany, as far as African football is concerned, Libya is not a threat to Nigeria. “Super Eagles have good players that have played on the international scene with lots of experience. Our players are more formidable and composed. All that is needed against Libya is just for them to be composed, understand themselves, enjoy the game and not be complacent.” The Confederation of African Football has since listed Jean-Jacques Ndala Nganbo of Cote d’Ivoire as the referee to be assisted by Oliver Safari Kabene and Nabina Blaise Sebutu both from Cote’ d’Ivoire. The officials are scheduled to arrive Nigeria on Thursday for the match. SHOCKING STORY!!!
