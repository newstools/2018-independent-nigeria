Lagos – Stoke City of England midfielder, Oghenekaro Etebo, has joined the injury list of Super Eagles players that is giving the technical crew concerns. Gernot Rohr, the Super Eagles manager, faces major crisis ahead of next month’s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against the Bafana Bafana of South Africa after defender, William Troost-Ekong limped out of his club’s league game on Saturday. Troost-Ekong picked up an injury in his Italian side, Udinese’s 3-0 home loss to title hopefuls, Napoli, and was replaced in the 35th minute by Ghanaian defender, Nicholas Opoku. Galatasaray forward, Henry Onyekuru, has been ruled out of action for up to six weeks as a result of the injury he picked up in Nigeria’s last 2019 AFCON qualifying fixture against Libya. Etebo was early Tuesday ruled out of his team’s English Championship clash away to Sheffield United later same day, due to a hamstring injury. Tests carried out after he returned to the United Kingdom last week revealed that he suffered a hamstring injury while on international duty, and Etebo does not want to rush himself back from the strain. Etebo’s absence is a huge blow for Stoke, who were relegated from the English Premier League last season, but are struggling in the lower division this season as well. The Super Eagles top Group E with nine points from four games with South Africa who occupy second position trailing with just a point. Libya sit in third position with four points, while Seychelles have just one point. The Bafana Bafana – Super Eagles clash will hold on November 17 at FNB Stadium, Johannesburg.
