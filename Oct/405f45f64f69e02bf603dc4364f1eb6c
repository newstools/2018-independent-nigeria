Lagos – Rnagers International of Enugu coach, Gbenga Ogunbote, has said that the club will not compromise on its target at this year’s Federation Cup competition. Rangers on Wednesday beat defending champions, Akwa United, 4-2 on penalties in their quarterfinal tie played at the Sani Abacha Stadium, Kano. He said the club would approach the remaining matches’ one after the other. “It was hard and we expected it and prepared well for it. Thank God we did not lose our heads after going behind but kept pushing and got the equalizer that took the game to penalty kicks. Yes, two more matches to go and we shall take them one at a time. We have our target,” he said. It will be recalled that the five time Federation Cup champions forced Akwa United to a 1-1 draw at the end of the 90 minutes duration time before the match entered the penalty kicks which they eventually won 4-2. Godwin Aguda converted the winning spot kick for Rangers after Michael Ibe and Jemiu Alimi had missed for Akwa United. SHOCKING STORY!!!
