Watford of England striker, Isaac Success said he is happy to finally claim victory over several battles with injuries, as he believes he is now fit like a fiddle and set to prove his true potential. After getting his first starting role with The Hornets last weekend in the English Premier League, Success is happy that the blight, which almost caused him to leave the club, is now over. Success stated as much Monday morning on Mega Sports programme on Star FM, Lagos, during which he admitted that his return to prime spot at Watford and return to the Super Eagles are only because he has been able to stay fit, unlike what was the case over the past four years. The UAE 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup gold medalist, who was on loan at Malaga of Spain last season, but also saw that spell wrecked by injuries, said he is optimistic of getting more chances in the Premier League. Success said, “I am happy that I have no more injuries. My fitness levels are good and I will be able to give more to Watford and the fans. “Week in week out, I want to be part of the team and watch them grow. I’m proud of the team. I’m just happy to be part of this great team.”
