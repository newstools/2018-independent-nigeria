Lagos – A group of leading Edo business men and professionals have indicated their readiness to partner with the Edo State Sports Commission (ESSC) headed by Barrister Godwin Dudu-Orumen, to transform sports in the state. The group, the Edo Development Organization (EDO) comprising individuals of diverse professional background, a non-governmental organization looking to create value for Edo State through the realization of sustainable community- spirited initiatives, met recently in Benin City with Dudu-Orumen, the newly appointed chairman of the commission, who unfolded his vision for Edo State Sports. The meeting explored areas of cooperation between ESSC and the commission with EDO promising to throw its weight behind Dudu-Orumen’s efforts to reposition Edo sports to enable it reclaim its position as the hub of sporting excellence in the country. The group, which decried the deplorable state of sports in the state, said it was confident that with Dudu-Orumen, a renowned sports administrator noted for both his passion for sports development and unimpeachable integrity, a new dawn had arrived for sports in the State. Mr. Ekhator Osaretin Moses, who spoke on behalf of EDO, said that the group was ready to offer all the necessary support to ensure that Dudu-Orumen and his team at the commission meet the expectation of Governor Godwin Obaseki, who has shown strong commitment to transform sports in the state by having capable individuals drive the process. “We have had fruitful discussion with the Chairman of the Commission and his team. We have let them know that as a group of individuals committed to excellence and development of Edo State in every way possible, we are willing to partner with the commission to bring about significant improvement in Edo State sports”, he said.
