Indian police on Wednesday sent seven Rohingya Muslims, jailed since 2012 on charges of illegal entry, in a bus to the border to be deported to neighbouring Myanmar, a border police official told Reuters. “This is a routine procedure, we deport all illegal foreigners,” Bhaskar Mahanta, Additional Director-General of police in India’s northeastern state of Assam said. The UN refugee agency which has been doing refugee status determination of the Rohingya in the country, said it has requested access to this group of people to ascertain their needs of international protection and is awaiting a response from the authorities. The seven were apprehended in 2012 and have been in detention after they completed their sentence, according to officials. While most officials remained tight-lipped over their ethnicity, an official of Silchar Central Jail, where the seven are in detention said they are Rohingya Muslims. Meanwhile, an application has been moved in the Supreme Court which is hearing public interest litigation against deportation of Rohingyas against the decision to deport these seven persons. The Centre has asked the states to identity Rohingya ‘illegal immigrants’ for deportation. Officials of the Border Organisation of the Assam Police which deals with detection of foreigners said the seven persons will be sent back via Moreh in Manipur on Thursday. SHOCKING STORY!!!
