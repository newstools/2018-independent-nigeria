Twelve people were killed in Northern Ethiopia on Monday when a passenger bus collided with a truck, authorities said. Several others were injured in the collision, said Mekasha Tesfaye, chief officer of Road Traffic Study Bureau, North Shewa zone, Amhara regional state. He said North Shewa zone has in recent months witnessed a spate of traffic accidents. At least 43 people were killed in three major accidents in the last five months. Despite having one of the lowest per capita car ownerships in the world, deadly traffic accidents in Ethiopia are common, with blames put on bad roads, a flawed driving license issuance system and lax enforcement of safety rules. Traffic accidents in the year that ended on July 7 led the death of 4,500 people.
