Lagos – Super Eagles Medical team will have to certify Enyimba’s Ikechukwu Ezenwa fitness for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Libya on Saturday in Uyo. Ezenwa, who sustained injury in their 4-2 Federation Cup quarter final loss to Kano Pillars, has declared himself fir for the Super Eagles game. But, Toyin Ibitoye, the Super Eagles media officer, has said that Ezenwa would still be certified fit for the match in Uyo, while assuring that no matter what happened, he would certainly be available for the return leg in Tunisia. ”Ezenwa is a very strong goalkeeper and he knows exactly what the requirements are for you to get to the national team and he knows if he is not going to be up to it. ”I’m sure the doctors and physios will work on him and find out, and the coaches will take a final decision on him for the match on Saturday. ”There is nothing for us to worry about, that department is adequately covered and absolutely no need for us to fear,” said Ibitoye. Ezenwa has not played for the Super Eagles in their last ten matches, with manager Gernot Rohr prefering Francis Uzoho as the undisputed first choice. SHOCKING STORY!!!
