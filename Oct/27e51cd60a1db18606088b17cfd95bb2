Mongolia’s main goal is to facilitate the continuation of the dialogue,” said the minister, as quoted by RIA Novosti. According to Tsogtbaatar, Mongolian authorities also invited the DPRK leader to visit the country on an official visit as this year marks 70 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

At the same time, the DPRK announced Pyongyang or Panmunjom as the places for the summit. SHOCKING STORY!!!
