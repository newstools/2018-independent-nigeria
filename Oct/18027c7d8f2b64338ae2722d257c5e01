AWKA – International Society for Human Rights and the Rule of Law (Intersociety), a human rights group based in Onitsha, has said that for the world to enjoy permanent peace, the United Nations must carry out comprehensive reforms of its rule of business. In a letter addressed to the heads of UN, signed by the group’s Principal Head, Emeka Umeagbalasi, and Head, Campaign and Publicity Desk, Chidinma Udegbunam, the group said that “the gateway to world peace remained comprehensive reforms in the UN and facilitation of permanent peace in the Israel-Palestine conflict. It said that the UN should be disbanded and replaced with a new world order devoid of nuclear and small arms capable of threatening world peace. The group said its findings show that the major cause of Israeli-Palestine conflict is land/space issue and suggested Canada and Algeria parting with part of land to Israel and Palestine respectively. In the arrangement, it said Israel should allow the ceding of parts of East Jerusalem. Among other measures suggested by the group include neutralisation of veto power wielded by the five permanent members of the Security Council; membership of the Security Council should be expanded, strengthened and given universal limited benchmark; all dictators that have overstayed their tenure in office be banned from attending the UN Assembly sessions and UN should expand, strengthen and protect the membership and work of its bodies. Others included determination of the territories of the 64 sovereign states; looking into the fate of others agitating for sovereign home lands through non-violence as happened in Nigeria, protected and guided to point of peaceful resolution and for the UN to strengthen democracy around the world, among others.
