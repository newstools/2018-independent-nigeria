Abuja – The presidency has written off threats by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, saying his outburst of returning to the country with hell was hollow. A statement by Senior Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, on Tuesday, in Abuja described Kanu’s bizarre episodic threats as distractions to the government and an attempt to strain Nigeria’s relationship with other nations. Recall that social media was abuzz with reports of Kanu spotted in Israel recently. “The presidency wishes to restate that Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari is strong enough to defend its territory against any threat. “All Nigerians should be assured that there is no reason to worry about the hollow outburst by Nnamdi Kanu, the disputed leader of IPOB, on returning to the country ‘with hell’. “Instead, we see the re-enactment of his bizarre, episodic threat as a mere distraction which will not be allowed to detract from the existing cordial relations between Nigeria and other countries. “The Buhari administration is in constant touch with other friendly nations and has the best assurances that they would continue to reciprocate the respect Nigeria has for the sovereignty of their nations. Nigerians have nothing to fear from this,” Shehu stated.
