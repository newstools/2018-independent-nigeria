ABUJA – The Senatorial candidate under the platform of Justice Must Prevail Party (JMPP), Mrs. Favour Shuab Ishember, has vowed to unseat the incumbent senator and former governor of Benue state, Mr. George Akume in the forthcoming general elections. Ishember, a practising journalist based in Abuja who is vying for the Benue North-West senatorial district told journalists during a world press conference that 2019 general election will be a retirement election for old politicians in the state, stressing that she will stop at nothing to unseat the incumbent senator no matter his perceived popularity. Her words: “My mission is like a battle between the Biblical David and Goliath and assured that she will bring about revolutionary legislation to the good people of Benue North-West senatorial district.” She, however, acknowledged that her party, JMPP, has no silver or gold to buy votes, but like the biblical Peter healing the crippled man at the beautiful gate without silver and gold, Justice Must Prevail Party is divinely positioned to win the 2019 general elections at all levels of representations.
