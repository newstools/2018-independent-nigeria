Gov. Abubakar Bello of Niger on Tuesday in Minna said there was the need for more support for sports development in view of its role as a unifying factor. The governor, while receiving the torch of unity for the 2018 National Sports Festival (NSF), said this would also contribute to the development of the nation. “Nigeria has no option than to be united as one people. The only thing that has been a unifying factor among us is sports. So, we have to encourage sports in whatever capacity,’’ he said. Bello promised that the state government would do everything possible to encourage sports men and women from the state to participate in the 19th NSF billed for Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the 2018 NSF is scheduled to hold from Dec. 6 to Dec. 16. The governor, who was represented by his deputy, Ahmed Ketso, urged governments at all levels, organisations and individuals to contribute to the NSF to make it successful. Earlier, Emmanuel Babur, the state’s Commissioner for Sports Development, had also emphasised the fact that sports has been a unifying factor among Nigerians. Babur said preparations by the state contingent have reached an advanced level for a smooth participation in the NSF. Speaking also, Patrick Uwagbale, the North Central Coordinator, Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports, said the NSF seeks to promote friendship and unity through sports. He said Niger was the fourth state visited with the torch in preparation for the forthcoming NSF. NAN reports that the festival will feature 37 sports, with more than 10,000 athletes and officials featuring in the games. SHOCKING STORY!!!
