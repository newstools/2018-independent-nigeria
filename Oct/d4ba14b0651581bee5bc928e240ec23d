Bafana Bafana of South Africa coach, Stuart Baxter, has revealed that he was warned by Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, about the poor state of the Seychelles pitch. While Nigeria beat Seychelles 3-0, South Africa were forced into a goalless game, putting their qualification for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in jeopardy. Though the Baxter would not blame the goalless draw to the state of the pitch, he, however, admitted that the pitch was in a terrible state. ‘’I met the Nigerian coach in London and he told me that the pitch was the worst he’d ever played on in a competitive game and I agree with him and that’s not an excuse because we still did enough to win the game.’’ ‘’Immediately after the game, I was frustrated and angry with the way the game panned out,’’ Baxter told reporters. South Africa will host Nigeria at the FNB Stadium on November 17 with the winner sure to qualify for the tournament. SHOCKING STORY!!!
