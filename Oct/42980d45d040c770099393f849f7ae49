The heads of State and Government of the European Union (EU) are arriving on Wednesday in Brussels to participate in a summit on a possible agreement on an orderly exit by the United Kingdom from the Community bloc, or Brexit, among other matters. The meeting, according to the published agenda, will start with a get-together by British Prime Minister Theresa May and the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and 15 minutes later, with the head of the EU’s Executive Body, Jean-Claude Juncker. ‘I will ask Prime Minister May if she has any concrete proposals to break the deadlock and only these proposals can determine whether a definite breakthrough is possible’, Tusk stressed on Tuesday in an effort to bridge the parties’ positions. The EU-27 will then listen to May for a few minutes, before changing rooms to assess the real state of the Brexit negotiations and the existence of a favorable situation to agree on an orderly exit or to focus on the contingency plan for a complicated rupture. The leaders have pushed to unlock the terms of the agreement in October, including key issues such as the settlement of the border between the Republic of Ireland, a member of the EU, and Northern Ireland, a British province, although the president of the European Council admitted that the situation is pessimistic. On the second day, on Thursday, May will again join the European Council to tackle other important issues such as migration, internal security, monetary reform and international issues. During the three-day summit, the heads of State and Government will meet bilaterally with Tusk and Juncker, among others, to discuss issues of interest such as the Brexit itself, immigration, the budget, the euro zone’s architecture and the euro’s future SHOCKING STORY!!!
