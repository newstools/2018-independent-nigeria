ABUJA – Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige has criticised the organised labour for opposing the “no work no pay” policy, saying the administration of ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo passed it into law in 2004. He said the policy has been in existence but that the current administration was only trying to effect the policy hence the decision to forward a white paper to the National Assembly on the matter. Ngige gave the explanation on Friday at the State House, against the threat by the organised labour to embark on industrial action from November 6. He said the Economic Management Team would be meeting with state governors to harmonise positions on the ongoing negotiation with labour unions over the new minimum wage for workers. The minister faulted the position of the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) on the draft white paper on industrial harmony. According to him, the labour officials are misinformed about the draft white paper, saying the white paper did not oppose the inclusion of non-elected officials to lead the labour unions in negotiations.
