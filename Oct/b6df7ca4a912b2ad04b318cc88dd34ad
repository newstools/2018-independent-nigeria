Lagos – South Africa’s national team coach, Stuart Baxter has declared that he and his players are confident of beating Nigeria in next month’s decisive match of the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. Although his side unwittingly gave up their to surge to a leadership position in Group E by failing to beat Seychelles last time out, Baxter is relying on the fact that they beat Nigeria away in the first leg to pull off another famous win. The Bafana Bafana gaffer said there is nothing to be scared of, as they know the Super Eagles inside out and believes it will be victory all the way for his side on November 17 at FNB Stadium, Johannesburg. Baxter said his side will take with all seriousness next month’s AFCON 2019 Group E decisive qualification match, which will guarantee them a ticket t to play in Cameroon 2019. Following a goalless draw away to Seychelles, South Africa’s chances of qualifying for Africa’s soccer showpiece hangs by a tiny thread, but Baxter said Bafana Bafana are not relenting, as he said they still have their destiny firmly in their hands. “The situation has not really changed. If we had defeated Seychelles, we would still have to do the same things. “We still have to knock Nigeria over, if we can, and if we don’t then we’ve got to get something in Libya. “That would have been the same even if we got a couple more points, but it would have been very good for the confidence. “As things stand now, our surest route to the tournament in Cameroon is to get maximum points in our home match against Nigeria, which I am confident we can achieve”, he said.
