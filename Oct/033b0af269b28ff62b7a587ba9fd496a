Gernot Rohr, the Super Eagles manager, may face a major crisis ahead of next month’s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against the Bafana Bafana of South Africa after two defenders, William Troost-Ekong and Kenneth Omeruo, limped out of their respective clubs’ league games on Saturday. Troost-Ekong picked up an injury in his Italian side, Udinese’s 3-0 home loss to title hopefuls, Napoli, and was replaced in the 35th minute by Ghanaian defender, Nicholas Opoku. The 25-year-old has featured in all league games for Udinese this season following his summer arrival at the club from Bursaspor. The centre-back missed the Super Eagles match-day-two 2019 AFCON qualifying fixture against Seychelles in September as a result of injury. Omeruo, who made his first start for Spanish club, Leganes, in their 1-1 away draw against Valencia at the Estadio de Mestalla, was replaced by Gerard Gumbau after sustaining an injury. The extent of their injuries is not known at the moment, but Rohr will hope they are not a long term ones. Galatasaray forward, Henry Onyekuru, has been ruled out of action for up to six weeks as a result of the injury he picked up in Nigeria’s last 2019 AFCON qualifying fixture against the Mediterranean Knights of Libya. The Super Eagles top Group E with nine points from four games with South Africa who occupy second position trailing with just a point. Libya sit in third position with four points, while Seychelles have just one point. The Bafana Bafana – Super Eagles clash will hold on November 17 at FNB Stadium, Johannesburg. SHOCKING STORY!!!
