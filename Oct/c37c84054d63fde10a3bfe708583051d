Lagos – Enyimba will be guest of Raja Casablanca of Morocco in today’s second leg semi-final of the CAF Confederation Cup. The match kicks off at 8pm Nigerian time and will be live on Supersport 9. The two-time African champions will be hoping to upturn a 0-1 loss in Aba three weeks back in the first leg, thereby qualifying for the final of the only trophy yet to grace their cabinet. Enyimba must, against all odds, defeat their hosts by at least a 2-1 if they hope to qualify for the final. With such result, the most successful club in Nigeria’s history will qualify for the final on away goals rule. Enyimba are no strangers to dicey situations as they even conquered the continent twice in 2003 and 2004, getting past equally precarious situations in the process. Speaking to DAILY INDEPENDENT on the high expectations from the team, Felix Anyansi-Agwu, Enyimba’s chairman, said that the players had resolved to give their best and ensure that they remedy the bad situation. He urged for prayers from Nigerians. “The players understand what is at stake and they have vowed to give their all and see how they can reverse the situation. “I will ask every Nigerian to pray for the team because right now, it is a Nigerian club and not Enyimba. We can do it and I am sure of that,” he said. Speaking similarly, Coach Usman Abdallah, called on the players to take the game to their hosts, saying if Raja could score against them in Aba, there was no way they would not get past their hosts in Casablanca. “We have nothing to defend so we are going to take the game to them. I have told the players to take the ball away from them. They defeated us here and we are hoping to pay them back in the same manner,” he said.
