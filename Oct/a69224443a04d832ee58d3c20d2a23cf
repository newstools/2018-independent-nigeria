LAGOS – Super Eagles will attempt to confirm their superiority over Libya in their reverse fixture for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. In the first leg played in Uyo on Saturday, Super Eagles walloped The Mediterranean Knights 4-0 to keep alive their hopes of qualifying for the Nations Cup billed for Cameroon next year. Coach Gernot Rohr, after the victory in Uyo, said that they would approach the game differently and ensure they record another win. “It is not going to be easy but it is achievable. We will approach the match in Sfax differently as if the first leg has not been played. “I have the players that can do it and we will go for the three maximum points in other to qualify for the Nations Cup proper,” said Rohr. And so with hat-trick scorer, Odion Ighalo, acting captain, Ahmed Musa, enterprising Alex Iwobi and Samuel Kalu, the Super Eagles should be ready for another victory at the end of the encounter today. South Africa top Group E with seven points from three matches, while Nigeria are second with six points from the same number of matches. Libya are third with four points and Seychelles are at the rear of the table with no point. The first two teams in the group will qualify for the Nations Cup in Cameroon next year. SHOCKING STORY!!!
