Lagos – Vice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday in Lagos urged Nigerians to resist the return of politicians who stole Nigeria dry into power in 2019. To him, these politicians have nothing to aid the growth of Nigeria and don’t worth to be supported to grab power which they mercilessly used to impoverish the nation as a result of their corruption. Speaking at the commissioning of 1.5megawatts (MW) Independent Power Plant (IPP) in Lagos on Friday, Osinbajo said the corruption, not tribalism and religiosity, is the biggest ill undoing the progressive of the country, adding that the current administration is on the path of setting the country aright through policies that would add value to Nigerians. He said one of such policies is the Tradermoni which is targeted at empowering two million Nigerians with N20 billion, which is more rewarding that the previous administration that withdrew $292million in a day from the Central Bank of Nigeria and converted same into private private pockets. Emphasising that Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) is the future of the Nigerian economy, Osinbajo however advocated the need for more private sector partnership in achieving the federal government’s goals of economic development through MSME development. He stated that the administration’s goal is to implement improvements, reforms and interventions that will be visible not merely in the global rankings, but impactful in the lives and of business owners and entrepreneurs across the entire country.
