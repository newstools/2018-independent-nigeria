Lagos – Foreign Embassies and High Commissions in Nigeria have been enjoined to mobilise support for their players at the ongoing Lagos Open Tennis Championship. No fewer than 125 emerging tennis players from 47 countries are competing at the championship with venue at the Lagos Lawn Tennis Club, Lagos. A total package of $100,000 will be won by players (men, women and doubles) in the two-legged tournament. The first leg final will hold on Saturday, October 6, 2018. Prince Wale Oladunjoye, the Tournament Director said that supports from the embassies to the players will serve as morale boosters and motivations for them as they compete in the International Tennis Federation (ITF) approved tournament in Lagos. “We have players from at least 47 countries here playing at the Lagos Open, so nationals of these countries’ embassies should come and support their own. We are appealing to the staff of the embassies to come with flags like you see in other sports competitions. ‘We always have spectators from the Indian community in Lagos coming to watch their players. ‘Last year, we have the Israelis in their numbers supporting the Israeli competitors. Even just clapping for the players can made a different because them will be motivated, “ Oladunjoye said. SHOCKING STORY!!!
