Lagos – The Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) has once again snubbed referees from Nigeria as it reeled out names of the continent’s top officials for a historic six-day preparatory course for the deployment of Video Assistant Referee (VAR) in the final of the 2018 CAF Champions League and CAF Confederation Cup. However, Papa Bakary Gassama of The Gambia tops the list of Grade A referees and assistant referees selected by CAF for the course, which will run from October 24 to October 29, 2018. It will be recalled that last month, the Executive Committee of the continental football body approved VAR for the CAF Champions League and CAF Confederation Cup finals after it ruled that the testing during the CAF Super Cup in February got top ratings. According to Amr Fahmy, the CAF General Secretary, “This is a historic moment for African football. It clearly shows that CAF is determined and committed to the interclub competitions and will bring on board the latest and innovative technologies to make it better. “We (CAF) are the first confederation to use VAR in the final of the club competitions. We did it for the CAF Super Cup and we are delighted to go a step further with the Interclub competitions.” Meanwhile, the full List of selected referees and assistant referees selected for the historic course include Janny Sikazwe (Zambia), Ghead Grisha (Egypt), Mehdi Abid Charef (Algeria), Bamlak Tessema (Ethiopia), Victor Gomes (South Africa) and Papa Bakary Gassama (Gambia).
