A former head of Britain’s overseas intelligence agency says Brexit could leave Britain more vulnerable to attacks like the nerve-agent poisoning of a former Russian spy in Salisbury. John Sawers, who led MI6 between 2009 and 2014, says “I don’t believe Russia would have used a nerve agent on the streets of an American or German city” because the consequences would be too great. He says Britain’s “very weakness – as a result of Brexit, as a result of fraying trans-Atlantic ties – was an attraction for Russia.” Sawers gave a speech Friday in Salisbury, where spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in March with the nerve agent Novichok. Britain says the attack was ordered at a senior level of the Russian government, a claim Moscow denies. SHOCKING STORY!!!
