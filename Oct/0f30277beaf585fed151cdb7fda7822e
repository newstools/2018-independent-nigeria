Lagos – The Nigerian stocks market performed positively yesterday following buy interest in high capitalised stocks as third quarter results of companies released to the investing public.

The upturn was significantly impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Dangote Cement, Nigerian Breweries, FBN Holdings, Zenith Bank and Fidelity Bank. Analysing the market, the chief operating officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Mr. Ambrose Omordion, said that already, companies that have released their third quarter numbers include United Bank for Africa (UBA), Guaranty Trust Bank, Lafarge Africa and Zenith Bank. “We note that the numbers have been mixed as performance of the financial service providers were boosted by trading and other incomes, rather than their traditional interest income, while Lafarge posted loss. “We expect the oscillating trend to continue as more companies present their numbers in the coming days, amidst increased bargain hunting activities, while volatility and profit taking continue, if the numbers beat market and analysts forecast.” He noted that the much anticipated Q3 earnings reports would assist investors and fund managers rebalance their portfolios, while watching the political space.
