Ado-Ekiti – The whereabouts of Oba Edward Ajayi, the traditional ruler of Ilogbo-Ekiti, is yet unknown after a violent attack on his palace by angry residents. The embattled monarch was accused of complicity in a cult-related attack which led to the death of a member of the community. The community erupted in crisis after the latest cult war claimed the life of a boy. The onslaught, according to residents, was allegedly led by the embattled monarch’s son, Adeleye Ajayi. The Ilogbo residents claimed that the attack by the suspected cultists led to the death of the boy. A source in the community claimed that Adeleye was expelled from a university in Ondo State for alleged cultism related activities about five years ago. “The prince and his group have been terrorising our community with the shield and protection of the palace. “The people were forced into violence because of the failure of the Oba to put his child and his group under check. “Sacred trees usually cut when a king dies have since been cut down while the palace and the Oba’s cars were vandalised,” the source said. The Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Caleb Ikechukwu, confirmed the arrest of the suspects, adding that the incident was still under investigation. “Seven persons, including the Oba’s son, have been arrested in connection with the incident while the body of the boy killed has been deposited in the mortuary.” All efforts to get the monarch’s reaction proved abortive as his line was shut.
