The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Wing has called for tactical collaboration between the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo for progress and development of the Southeast. The group made the call in Owerri on Wednesday in a statement issued by Mr Osmond Nkeoma, its national publicity secretary, after its 5th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting. The group, however, disassociated itself from “the untimely and uncalculated pronouncements” of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, when he called on the Igbo not to vote in 2019 general election. It said that by disenfranchising themselves during elections, the Igbo would be encouraging rigging and this would not help Nigerians, especially the Igbo, to take the mantle of leadership. “The leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youths (Worldwide) still stands on a restructured Nigeria. “We will canvass for and vote for the presidential candidate who buys into our restructuring ideas. We are Igbo; we have a stake in the Nigerian project. We will vote because if we fail to, the election will still hold and Nigeria will continue. Boycotting the elections will not benefit anyone,” it said. The group urged all reasonable Igbo persons resident, working or doing business in Nigeria to vote during the elections. The group thanked God for keeping the life of Kanu, “but his recent declaration had proved, contrary to most unpopular belief, that Ohanaeze Ndigbo has no hand in his travails and sudden disappearance.”
