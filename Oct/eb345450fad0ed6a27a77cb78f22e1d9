FELIX IGBEKOYI and Steve Oma-Ofozor ASABA, Lagos – Rangers completed a fantastic comeback to win their sixth Federation Cup on Wednesday in Asaba, beating Kano Pillars 4-2 on penalties after the game ended 3-3 on regulation time. Rangers won the annual competition five times before the latest victory. They won it in 1974, 1975, 1976, 1981 and 1983. They were beaten finalist in 2000, 2004 and 2007. Pillars look set to be the first northern team to win the trophy after 29 years when they raced into a three goals lead after 48 minutes, but Rangers fought back to level the game a minute into the added time. Rabiu Aliu shot Pillars into the lead on fifth minute with Alassa Ibrahim doubling their lead on 20th minute. Nyima Nwagua made it three on 48 minutes. But Rangers started their comeback on 77th minute through Kelvin Itoya’s screamer that hit the roof of the net. On 82nd munite Chidera Ezeh drags Rangers back in contention, with Ajani Ibrahim leveling the game a minute into the six minutes of added time. Meanwhile, Christian Chukwu, former Rangers General Manager, has called on Enugu State Government to do something remarkable for Rangers after winning the cup. This victory Chukwu believed deserved worthy reward for the club who last won the trophy 34 years ago (1984) when he was the coach. “This is a wonderful performance by the team (Rangers). To come from three goals down to win the trophy is not a joke; though is not my capacity to tell government to reward the team, but I think they deserve to be rewarded wonderfully.”
