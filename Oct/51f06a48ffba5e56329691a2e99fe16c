A suicide bomber blew himself up near the gate of Afghanistan’s largest prison on Wednesday, killing at least six people, officials said. The sprawling Pul-e-Charkhi prison in Kabul houses hundreds of inmates, including scores of Taliban. However, there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Afghan Interior ministry spokesman, Najib Danish, said the attacker detonated his explosive near a vehicle carrying prison employees. Six people died near the gate of the prison on the eastern outskirts of the city and eight were wounded, another government official said. “The attacker walked towards a vehicle that was parked at a gate for security clearance. “He blew himself up before the vehicle could enter the prison premises,” the official said. An Afghan news website said women security officials were in the vehicle at the time of the attack.
