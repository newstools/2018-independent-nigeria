IBADAN – Dr. Olapade Agoro, the Owa ‘Tapa of Itapa Ijesha has advised the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi, to promote Olojo Festival into a global trado – cultural festival. Agoro also congratulated Ooni ‘risa Adeyeye Ogunwusi and the people of Ife on the occasion of this year’s edition of Olojo Festival. The Owa ‘Tapa of Itapa Ijesha noted that Olojo Festival is not the people of Ile – Ife alone, but for all Yorubas. According to him, Olojo is the first among all festivals in Yorubaland  and should be celebrated by all Yoruba people. He maintained that Ooni ‘risa Ogunwusi will be writing his name in gold, if he promotes the Olojo Festival beyond the enclave of Ile – Ife, to a global sphere. His words: “The Ooni ‘risa Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi should capitalize on his youthful experience and positional callings to uplift the Olojo Festival beyond the enclave of Ife to a global sphere. Let it be noted that before that lady Susan came on board to bring the Osun Osogbo into limelight, celebration of Osun Osogbo was a localised matter. “ The attention of UNESCO was drawn to the festival during Oyinlola’s regime. People like Otunba Gani Adams, the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, also threw his weight behind the promotion of the Osun Osogbo Festival, with his Oodua People’s Congress (OPC). “The Ooni should similarly go on to make the Olojo Festival the first of its kind among trado – cultural festivals all over Africa. No doubt, from the ancient time, those who became Ooni ‘risa were indeed custodians of Yoruba honour and pride”. SHOCKING STORY!!!
