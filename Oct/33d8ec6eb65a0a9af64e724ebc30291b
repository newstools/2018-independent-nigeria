President of the National Coalition of Niger Delta Ex-Agitators, (NCNDE-A), Eshanekpe Israel, has lambasted the Coalition of Progressive Niger Delta Ex-militants (CPNDE) for criticizing his group’s opposition to President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election in 2019 poll. In an interview with pressmen in Abuja, Israel described the Edeinowei Galabagaba led-group as faceless. He stated that the group was grandstanding for crumbs from the operators of the current political system, adding that their days were numbered on account of the overwhelming rejection of the President Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration by Nigerians in general and Niger Deltans in particular. According to the erstwhile pro ex-militant leader, Galabagada leads a bunch of “unknown elements” who he noted have found occupation in making uninformed comments and arrogating unfounded electoral value to itself whereas both the organisation and it’s pilots were not known to the politics of the Niger Delta Amnesty Programme. The Buhari administration, Israel, who doubles as the coordinator of the Urhobo Youth Forum for Change (UYFC), stated, has run the Nigerian state saying; ‘except one is drunk in the water and spirit of blind sycophancy” no contemporary citizen of Nigeria will support the APC government. He challenged the group to tell Nigerians what side of the divided it was existence in 2014, noting that his support for Buhari dated back to 2013 but has found out that the administration was dishonest, ethnic and does not mean well for the Niger Delta region.
