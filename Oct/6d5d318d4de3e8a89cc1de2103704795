The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has banned Libya goalkeeper, Muhammad Nashnoush, from playing against Nigeria in today’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. The captain received an automatic one-match ban after picking up a booking in the fifth minute of the match day-three fixture against the Super Eagles in Uyo last Saturday. Nashnoush is one of Libya’s most important players and was in goal when they won the 2014 African Nations Championship in South Africa. The Al-Ahly Tripoli star has gone the distance in all the matches played by the North Africans in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. Wilfred Ndidi, William Troost-Ekong, Kenneth Omeruo and Kelechi Iheanacho are the Nigerian players that have been yellow carded in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. The Super Eagles players and officials flew to the Tunisian city of Sfax on Monday morning. SHOCKING STORY!!!
