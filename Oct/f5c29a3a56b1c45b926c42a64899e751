Umuahia – Fifteen years after its production was stalled following the blowing of its brewing boiler, former workers of Golden Guinea Breweries  (GGB), Umuahia, have pleaded with the core Investor to consider them while recruiting new staff. The former staff whose number could not be ascertained, made the plea in an address presented by National Union of Food, Beverages and Tobacco Employees (NUFBTE)  during areception it held in honour of the core Investor to GGB , Sir Okey Nzenwa, after a thanksgiving service at the St. Finbarrs’ Catholic Church, Umuahia. Chairman of NUFBTE, Comrade Samuel Amanze, said their plea had become necessary going by rumours of their possible exclusion of the old workers during recruitment of new workers. “In a special way, we want to use this opportunity to request the core investor to do the needful by recalling and reintegrating all our existing (workers) members of staff before the employment of new workers. This will give the management the actual number of vacancies to be filled. This plea has become necessary going by recent happenings and rumours making rounds,” he said. Revealing what led to the thanksgiving and mini-reception for the core Investor 15 years after the company stopped production, Amanze said it was to thank God for binging a core Investor who has shown commitment to ensuring that the moribund factory bounced back to production soonest. “We are thanking God for bringing an investor in the person of Okey Nzenwa who has been working assiduously to ensure that the Golden Guinea Breweries bounces back in to full operation in no distance time. In his response, Nzenwa remarked that he was impressed by the gathering after 15 years the company had gone moribund due to boiler explosion in 2003. While he prayed for the four departed staff who lost their lives in the tragic incident, he urged the staff to prepare for full commencement of work as arrangement had been concluded to engage each one of them.
