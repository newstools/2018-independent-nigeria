The Lagos State Law Reform Commission, for instance, in 2017, stressed the need to review certain provisions of the Lagos State Tenancy Law of 2011 with a view to further ensuring fairness and reposition the law to reflect present societal values and realities. Speaking at the stakeholders’ meeting on Tenancy Law of Lagos State organised by the Commission, the State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Adeniji Kazeem at the time said the modernisation of Lagos into a smart city made it imperative that its legislations reflect modern day realities, especially in the provision of shelter. The Commissioner added that the proposed review of the law was also part of the ease of doing business drive of the State government aimed at drastically reducing all bottlenecks capable of hampering commerce and other practices that negate global practices applicable in developed countries of the world. Kazeem said that feelers from members of the public reveal that the citizens were not pleased with the present state of the law, hence the need to consider the introduction of rules of procedure to help fast-track proceedings for recovery of possession and propose time limits for the disposal of tenancy matters, among other grey areas contained in the law. The Attorney-General stated that like every other piece of legislation, the law requires periodic review in line with the government’s housing policies as a way of dealing with insufficient housing problem due to the fast growing population of the State.  He reiterated that the existing Lagos Tenancy Law was a compilation of the reviewed Recovery of Premises Law Cap 118 Laws of Lagos State 2003 and the Rent Control and Recovery of Residential Premises Edict No. 6 of 1997. The Commissioner maintained that some aspects of the law had not really been obeyed by the concerned stakeholders, noting that the section of the law on advance payment which makes it unlawful for a landlord to receive more than a year’s rent in advance was still being flouted. The Commissioner expressed the hope that the State House of Assembly would ensure speedy adoption and passage into law, the resolutions that would be inserted in the proposed bill as would be presented by the Law Reform Commission upon review of the law. On her part, the Chairman of the Lagos State House of Assembly Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights, Public Petitions and LASIEC, Hon.A.A.Funmilayo Tejuosho promised that the Assembly would ensure fairness in the passage of the law through a call for public hearing to reflect the opinion of the majority. She urged concerned stakeholders to also consider the issue of Agreement Fee charged by landlords, adding that whatever amendment that would be made to the law should be able to stand the test of time and bring comfort to all residents of the State. Not only that, as enshrined in the tenancy law, a tenant of a property, upon securing his or her landlord’s consent in writing to make some improvements on the premises, at  the termination of the tenancy, he or she is entitled to claim or compensation sequel  to reimbursement for the improvements made, when the tenant is quitting the premises. The provision, according to DAILY INDEPENDENT’s investigation hardly applies as tenants more often than not do not ask for reimbursements, and Landlords on their own have never been in ready disposition to remind them of the contractual agreement which they are consented to when quitting from the property. In the same vein, for a tenant that lives in a property that includes payments for a service charge, it is incumbent on the landlord or his agent to issue him with a separate receipt, and equally entitled to a written account for at least every 6 months from the Landlord on how monies that were paid were disbursed. As it is, despite the law which is said to be in force, tenants engaged by DAILY INDEPENDENT confessed that they are not experiencing such and more so that they are not in the least aware of the provision in the law. While faulting the law, Mbakwe said the Tenancy Law of Lagos 2011 was not designed to succeed from the outset. He explained that it appears the law was made to show that a new government had come to power and that anything done by the previous Military Administration had to be replaced. Mbakwe argued from the backdrop of the fact that a similar law known as 1997 Rent Control Edict promulgated during the administration of Brigadier-General Buba Marwa existed in Lagos. Mr. Philip Okiemute, an estate agent, who also expressed his views on the Tenancy Law, was pessimistic as he said that the law is not different from the Rent Control promulgated under Marwa’s administration. He said the law could not be enforced because, as estate surveyors and valuers put it, you cannot control what you don’t have. Mbakwe continued in his explanation and said, “During the tenure of .Marwa, 1997 Law was already in force and was observed by both Landlords and Tenants because of provisions that made their enforceability by Tribunals easy. He added that:  “The entire property in Lagos state were mapped into zones and property were categorised and rent enumerated. The facilities in houses and qualities of such houses determined the rent and any Landlord who charged above normal rent were made to refund the excess. There was sanity in residential premises and both landlords and Tenants played according to the rule. He said: “In 2011 Law, the only provision to ensure observance of or obedience to the Law is making it a crime for a prospective tenant to offer to pay more than one year rent at the point of taking the premises or the landlord demanding or taking more than one year rent. He reasoned that with this provision that it would be difficult for the law enforcement agency to be informed whenever the law is breached as both the prospective tenant and Landlord are culpable. “This is the provision that made nonsense of the law. Since the person who pays is as guilty as the person who receives, who then will report the Crime? He says a tenant who pays reports the landlord who receives, and he would be seen as having confessed to the crime and may be in jail before the trial of the Landlord who may deny the allegation’, he said. Ostensibly responding to recent move made by Lagos State Government to review the extant 2011 Tenancy Law, Mbakwe appealed that it should be expeditiously reviewed. He said, “My humble view is that the law as it is now cannot work unless it is amended to protect the teaming Tenants who are on the receiving end at all times” He suggested that “The Government should on their part make ownership of houses easier and, or support property developers and landlords in construction of houses especially residential houses by giving interest free facilities or allocate land to them in order to justify their intervention, intrusion or regulation. Above all Government should provide affordable houses for the masses by erecting storey or high-rise buildings of affordable apartments, The tenancy activist said: “NGO’s can come in by rising and championing amendment of the extant law for enforceability and in the interest of all and to mobilize citizens to ensure that Government provides governmental alternatives to housing needs of the people.” It would be recalled that The Lagos State Law Reform Commission, in July 2017, stressed the need to review certain provisions of the Lagos State Tenancy Law of 2011 with a view to further ensure fairness and reposition the law to reflect present societal values and realities.
