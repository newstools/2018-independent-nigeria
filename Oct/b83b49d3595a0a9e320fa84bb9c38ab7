Roger Federer was beaten by Croatia’s Borna Coric in the Shanghai Masters semi-finals but Novak Djokovic reached Snday’s final with a dominant victory. Swiss 20-time Grand Slam champion Federer, who will be replaced by Djokovic as world number two on Monday, lost 6-4 6-4 to Coric. Serb Djokovic thrashed German world number five Alexander Zverev 6-2 6-1 in just over an hour to reach the final. It will be Coric’s first final at a Masters 1000 tournament. Djokovic, 31, is on a 17-match winning streak, a run that includes titles at the US Open and Cincinnati Masters. The Wimbledon champion last lost a match in the Rogers Cup third round on 10 August. “Being number two after this tournament is also a great achievement, considering the first four, five months of the year and considering I had the [elbow] surgery,” said 14-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic. “Where I was about four months ago and where I am today is quite an extreme opposite. “I’m just cherishing that achievement and every moment spent on the court.” SHOCKING STORY!!!
