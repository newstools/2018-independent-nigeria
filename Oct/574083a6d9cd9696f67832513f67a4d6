LAGOS – Mayor John Echefu, president, Congress for Non-Political Party Members (CNPM), has said the rumour making rounds that Ike Ekweremadu, the Deputy Senate President, will dump the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC) is the handiwork of political opponents. He maintained that it was not possible for a man of integrity like Ekweremadu to defect to APC, which he described as a dying party. The activist, who spoke to DAILY INDEPENDENT, said it would be foolish for anyone to seek refuge in a house with a leaking roof, noting that the ruling APC had been in serious crises of recent, wondering why any right thinking human being would want to associate with a rejected party. He maintained that the credibility of the deputy senate president was not in question and that it would not be wise for him to want to join a party of people who had plotted his down fall. “It will be a foolish decision for the deputy senate president to take. He has not made any move to leave the party. Yesterday, he had come out to debunk the said rumour and you also know that he has got a PDP ticket to represent his people at the senate in 2019. “What will he be doing in APC if he defects now? I don’t know where all these speculations were coming from. I know Ekweremadu as a man of honour and I don’t think he would be ready to mess up himself politically,” he added.
