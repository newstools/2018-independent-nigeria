Lagos – Adel Al-Khumisi, the Managing Director of Libyan football team, has revealed that the two-legged matches against Nigeria would be vital to his country’s quest to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations again after their group stage exit at the 2012 edition in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. While speaking to libyaobserver.ly, Al-Khumisi assured Libyans that their national team would hopefully come back from the Nigerian game with the qualification card in their hands, even as he admitted that his statement was not meant to underrate the Super Eagles, “We will head for Nigeria to play against them in the third round of the AFCON 2019 qualifiers; I am promising Libyan fans that we will come back with the qualifying card in our hands. “This is because the match against Nigeria over the two legs will go a long way in determining our qualification. We are not underrating them but at the same time, we are not in a hurry to let go of our leadership of the group,” he said. It will be recalled that Libya is top of Group E of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers after its day-one 5-1 win over Seychelles and its goalless draw with the second-placed South Africa. Meanwhile, a win for Nigeria will push the three-time winners closer to making a return to the foremost continental football competition after back to back misses in 2015 and 2017. SHOCKING STORY!!!
