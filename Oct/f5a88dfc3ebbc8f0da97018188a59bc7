Awka – A former governorship aspirant and currently All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) candidate for Onitsha-North and South Federal Constituency seat in the 2019 general election, Chief Nwachi Bath Onochie Obianwu, says there is virtually no infrastructure in Onitsha-North and South federal constituency due to promises that were not kept by individuals who represented the constituency at the green chambers. Obianwu, who spoke to journalists in Onitsha concerning his mission to the House of Representatives, lamented that many promises made to the people of Onitsha-North and South federal constituency had not been fulfilled, stressing that non- fulfillment of campaign promises have become the order of the day in the constituency. He pointed out that there were no roads and other infrastructure necessary to enhance state of the constituency. The House of Representatives hopeful maintained that if elected into the green chambers in 2019, he would facilitate the completion of the second Niger-Bridge as well as attract more meaningful projects to his constituency. Obianwu, however, assured the constituents of Onitsha-North and South federal constituency that the era of unfulfilled electoral promises were over as he was prepared to launch a viable work plan to transform the constituency as well as usher infrastructure development in the area. Although he acknowledged Governor Willie Obiano’s developmental strides across the state and explained that he would borrow a leaf from the governor’s development model to enable him replicate the same in his constituency, he noted that Onitsha-North and South was in dire need of indices that would qualify it as a federal constituency.
