Lagos – Chairman of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo State, Mr. Clement Faboyede and Modupe Adetokunboh, the Director General of PDP Campaign Organisation in Ondo State, during the 2015 general election, on Friday asked Justice Saliu Saidu of a Federal High Court, Lagos, to withdraw from hearing of an alleged N500 million fraud suit filed against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The duo told the court that their call for the withdrawal of Justice Saidu from hearing the matter was on want of the court’s jurisdiction. Both Faboyede and Adetokunboh, in a motion filed through their lawyer, Eyitayo Jegede (SAN), are seeking for an order of the court dismissing or striking out the charge due to lack of jurisdiction. They claimed that none of the ingredients or acts alleged against them in the proof of evidence took place in Lagos, but in Akure, Ondo State. Following the agreement of the parties, the matter was adjourned till November 26, for hearing of application challenging the court’s jurisdiction. In an affidavit attached to the motion deposed by Faboyede, it was averred that all the defence witnesses were scattered across the 18 local government areas of Ondo State and that it would be difficult to bring them to Lagos to testify in the matter. Some of the witnesses were said to be civil servants who are residents of Ondo State.
