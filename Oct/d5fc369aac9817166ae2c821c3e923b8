Lagos – Two ex-internationals, Henry Nwosu (MON) and Ike Shorunmu have congratulated Super Eagles’ Alex Iwobi for winning the Man Of The Match (MOTM) award in Arsenal’s 3-1 defeat of Leicester in Monday’s Premier League. Iwobi churned out assists in the win at the Emirates. Nwosu, former Super Eagles captain and striker, said that it was a good development, urging him to get better. “I am happy for him and Nigerian football in general. This is the kind of performance that will assure the coach going forward. He is young, very athletic and ready to learn. I think we are yet to see what Iwobi can do for both club and country,” the Africa Cup of Nations winner said. Speaking in the same vein, while in a chat with our correspondent, former goalkeeper of the Super Eagles, Ike Shorunmu, applauded Iwobi for his performance, saying that the player remained a far improved footballer under Gunners’ new manager, Unai Emry. “Iwobi has not disappointed so far and I am happy that he is rewarding the faith of the new Arsenal coach in him. He has gotten far better under the new coach and I am happy for him, especially as Nigeria prepares for the Africa Cup of Nations. With his youthful age, he will do a lot better in years to come,” says the 2002 FIFA World Cup goalie, who is also the Super Eagles former goalkeeper trainer. Iwobi, who was on from start to finish at the Emirates on Monday, made a huge impact as his pace and skills caused the Leicester City players all sort of problems. The Nigerian international has though managed just one goal in all competitions in the colours of the Gunners this season.
