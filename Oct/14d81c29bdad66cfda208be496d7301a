Arsenal have continued to sing the praises of their number 17, Alex Iwobi, following his imperious display on match-day seven against Watford in the Premier League on Saturday after coming off the bench. The Hale End Academy product was at the heart of both goals scored by The Gunners, first forcing Craig Cathcart to score an own goal and was involved in the build up to Mesut Ozil’s goal. Manager, Unai Emery, hailed Iwobi during the post-match press conference, saying the winger has the quality to play right or left and can go past players on the pitch. In their review of the game, Arsenal wrote on their official website: ‘’But it was the introduction of Alex Iwobi on 63 minutes which did most to ignite Arsenal’s forward play, and the Nigerian was heavily involved in both goals, the first coming after the youngster got away on the right flank, stretching the play and forcing the own goal from Craig Cathcart.’’ Iwobi started two of Arsenal’s first three games in the Premier League but has been utilised off the bench in their last two matches after recovering from injury. The 22-year-old is expected to be named in the Super Eagles squad for their upcoming games against Libya in October. SHOCKING STORY!!!
