GOMBE – The Catholic Relief Service, in collaboration with the National and Gombe State Malaria Elimination Programme, will soon commence the distribution of over two million Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) across the 11 local government areas of Gombe State. The distribution, according to Zainab Ali, a representative of the Catholic Relief Service (CRS), will be carried out using technology devices and will commence with the registration of households from 3rd to 11th November 2018 while proper distribution will start on 24th and end on 28th November 2018. Ali made the disclosure during a media orientation for LLINs distribution in Gombe State where she said the 2,089,291 free bed nets will be done in 686 distribution points across the 11 LGAs of the state. She said CRS is strongly convinced that other partners in the national crusade for a malaria-free nation will at the end of the campaign agree with CRS that the best strategy for LLINs distribution campaign is with the use of the Cash and Asset Transfer (CAT) strategy. “We would like to thank the Gombe State Executive Secretary of the Primary Health Care Development Agency, the state Commissioner for Health and his management team for the very strong commitment to the implementation of this cash and asset transfer strategy for LLINs replacement campaign in Gombe State,” she stated. Ali also thanked other development partners in the fight against malaria, stressing that, “meeting the health needs of the people can only succeed if we do it together”. The Gombe State Programme Manager of the Gombe State Malaria Elimination Programme, Mohammed Lawal, commended the media for their participation in the programme, especially in enlightening the public over the programme, saying, “The programme can’t be successful without the media’s role of enlightening our communities.”
