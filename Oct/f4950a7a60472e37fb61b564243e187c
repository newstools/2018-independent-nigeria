Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh accepted his nomination and was ceremonially sworn in to his position on the federal bench by retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy at the White House on Monday. President Trump gave brief remarks praising Kavanaugh and thanking several Republican senators for their support of his nomination. Kavanaugh said he was thankful for the “steadfast, unwavering support throughout this process.” “Mr. President, thank you for everything,” he said. He called Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. “independent and inspiring,” and added that he too will interpret the law in the same way, without regard to partisan politics. “A good judge must be an umpire, an impartial decider.” Kavanaugh said he will “always be a team player on the team of nine.” He thanked Kennedy for his service to the nation, and spoke about how he clerked for the justice in 1993. Kavanaugh said he already has hired his first four law clerks, noting that he is the first justice to employ a team entirely made up of women. He also thanked Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) for their strong support and guidance throughout the nomination process.
