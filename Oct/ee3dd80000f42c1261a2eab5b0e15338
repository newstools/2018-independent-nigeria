Ireland remains the biggest issue. Speaking in Parliament on Monday, Theresa May has said that she is prepared to “explore every possible option” to ensure that the Brexit deadlock is broken. She told MPs that 95% of the terms of the exit had been agreed, but that the Irish border was the “considerable sticking point”. According to BBC, May said that she may consider extending the UK’s transition period beyond 2020, but she said that this was “undesirable”, and that the entire saga should end “well before” 2022. #AD
This news comes less than 24 hours after it was reported that May had 72 hours to save her job. Labour are also putting pressure on May, as Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer claims the current situation is a “mess of the prime minister’s own making”. In the Sunday Times, Starmer said: “To say that things have gone very wrong is an understatement. “Things could – and should – have been different. “But at no stage has the prime minister ever reached out to parliament or sought to build a national consensus on our future relationship with the EU.”
