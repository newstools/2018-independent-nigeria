LAGOS – Joseph Erico Ameh, the governorship aspirant in Kogi State on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) platform, has urged Atiku Abubakar, the party’s presidential candidate, to focus his campaigns on how he plans to solve the myriad of problems facing the country. Ameh, who spoke to DAILY INDEPENDENT in Lagos on Monday, said that Atiku should shun negative criticisms by the opposition and endear himself more to the Nigerian people by coming out with plans to turn the nation around. The aspirant, a security expert, who congratulated Atiku for emerging victorious during the PDP primaries in Port Harcourt on Sunday, said the people of Middle Belt and Nigerians would like to know how he intended to tackle the problems of herdsmen’s killings, which he stressed, had sent farmers out of their farms, thereby raising fears of imminent famine in the country. Ameh also said that Atiku should come up with plans on how he would tackle unemployment, which he stressed, had been behind youth restiveness, even as he advised him to immediately set up a team of experts from different parts of the country to come out with a master-plan on economic development of the country. He said, “Atiku should carry people from the six geo-political zones along, de-emphasise ethnicity and religion to ensure that Nigeria remains one united nation.” “For him to be victorious in the 2019 election, he should ensure that people from South-West, South-South, South-East and Middle Belt play prominent roles in his campaign to neutralise the All Progressives Congress (APC) across the country.
