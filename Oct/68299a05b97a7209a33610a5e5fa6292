The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has commenced an investigation into alleged financial misappropriation involving at least five officials of the Ministry of Finance in Abia. The stateâ€™s Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi, made the disclosure on Friday in Umuahia during a joint news briefing with the Commissioner for Finance, Mr Obinna Oriaku, Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Enyinnaya Appolos, and Dr. Moses Orji, a media aide to the governor. According to the commissioner, the anti-graft probe was prompted by a petition from the fellow commissioner in the state Civil Service Commission, Mr Guy Okite. He disclosed that four of the suspects worked in the payroll unit of the ministry of finance, saying that the finance commissioner was also invited to shed light on some of the issues raised by the petitioner and had since returned to his work. Okiyi said that while two of the suspects were still being detained by EFCC, three others, including Oriaku, would only report to the commission whenever the need arises. The commissioner, who did not disclose the names of other suspects, said that the thrust of the investigation followed the 2017 annual report of the state audit team. He, however, said that the petitioner should not have gone ahead with the petition since the contentious issue in the report had already been withdrawn by the same audit unit. SHOCKING STORY!!!
