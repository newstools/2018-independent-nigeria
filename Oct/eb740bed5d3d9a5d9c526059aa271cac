Lagos – Coach Adel Amrouche of the Mediterranean Knights of Libya has said there is no cause for alarm over injured midfielder, Tarek Al-Jamal, who will miss the two legs of the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier between his team and the Super Eagles of Nigeria. SUNDAY INDEPENDENT gathered that the coach has assured the Libyan Football Federation (LFF) that though, the team would miss Al-Jamal, there was nothing to fear in his absence. “He is a good player and there is no doubt that we will miss him in the two legs of the qualifiers, but there is no cause for fear. “We can go ahead with the qualifiers without him and still get good results but we will miss him for sure”, Amrouche was quoted by the LFF. The player was injured on club duty and has been replaced with Al-Ahly of Tripoli’s Mahmoud Walou for the two legged encounters. Nigeria host the crucial first leg at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State on October 13. The Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) has already picked Democratic Republic of Congo referee, Jean-Jacques Ndala Ngambo, for the encounter. Meanwhile, Libya have chosen the southeast of Tunis as their home for the return fixture of the double header following the civil war in their country and the match will likely hold at the 18,000-capacity Stade Taïeb Mhiri, which hosted some of the games of the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations when Tunisia hosted the competition. Botswana referee, Joshua Bondo, will be at the centre in Sfax for the return leg. Libya, Nigeria, South Africa and Seychelles are in the same group of the qualifiers with the top two teams qualifying for the Nations Cup billed for Cameroon next year. SHOCKING STORY!!!
