Lagos – Despite Enyimba’s 1-0 loss to Raja Casablanca Enyimba in their CAF Cup semi-final first leg game in Aba on Wednesday, Austin Oladapo, the team’s midfielder, believes that hopes are not lost yet. He said in an interview with DAILY INDEPENDENT on Thursday that there was still everything to fight for in the second leg in Morocco. He expressed the confidence that they could get the job done in Morocco, even though he acknowledged how difficult it would be. According to him, Enyimba did not set out to lose the match in Aba but blamed the unfortunate situation on ill-luck, citing the missed penalty to buttress his point. “Nobody enters the filed with the intention of losing, so we did not want to lose or even draw the match. It was unfortunate that the result went that way. If we had scored that penalty, we could even win the match. We still have a lot to fight for in Morocco because the result over there could go either way,” he said. Enyimba must win Raja Casablanca with anything from 2-1 or 3-2 upwards to stand any chance of progressing to the finals. It is obviously a difficult situation for the Peoples Elephants, but like the popular saying goes; it is not over until it is over. However, former Super Eagles coach, Samson Siasia believes Raja won on the back of a game plan that worked for them. He said in an interview that Raja played as a unit when lauching attack, while Enyimba played an uncoordinated game failing to vary their game plan. Enyimba, he said, did not vary their style, their attack was poor, urging them to plan properly for the return leg in Morocco. SHOCKING STORY!!!
