Current inflation is likely to rise over the coming months in Nigeria on the back of increased food price pressures, and higher government spending in the run-up to the February presidential and legislative elections, report from Fitch Solutions Macro Research has said. The report also disclosed that the authorities will remain keen to support sluggish economic growth and limit currency instability, creating contradictory pressures. According to the report, “we expect the authorities to keep the policy rate on hold for the remainder of 2018. However, the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) may be increased from the current 22.5% in Q418 if financial market liquidity increases. While the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has stated that the bank will continue to adopt a tightening stance in the foreseeable future, we think it is more likely to cut by a modest 100 basis points in 2019.” The Fitch Solutions Macro Research report revised up the 2019 inflation forecast from 10.5% to 13.5%, reflecting increased price pressures arising from food production constraints in the Middle Belt region and the impact of higher government spending ahead of the February elections. It expects the CBN to reduce the country’s policy rate by 100 basis points (bp) in 2019, compared with a 200bp reduction previously, because of increased inflationary pressures. The central bank will seek to balance the competing demands of bolstering economic growth, limiting currency instability and limiting inflation. “Inflation is expected to accelerate modestly over the coming quarters, owing largely to increased food price pressures, and higher government spending around the presidential and legislative polls due in February 2019. Average annual inflation rose to 11.2% y-o-y in August from 11.1% the previous month—the first increase since January 2017—on the back of higher food price pressures. “Further increases are likely in the coming months, since August-September floods in the key Middle Belt region threaten to undermine agricultural output. Meanwhile the government is likely to boost spending in the run-up to the February 2019 polls. “The 2018 budget, running from January to December but finally passed in May, targets a 22.5% increase in government expenditure, while the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) continues to press for an increase in the national minimum monthly wage from N18,000 ($49.6) to N65,000. “Overall, we are forecasting annual average inflation of 12.4% in 2018, rising to 13.2% in 2019 as a result of the fiscal stimulus arising from the 2018 budget. “However, economic growth, particular in core sectors, remains extremely weak. Real GDP grew by just 1.5% y-o-y in Q218, down from 2.0% in Q117,” the report posited. “While this was majorly attributable to a slowdown in oil production, non-oil growth was also weighed down by the continued underperformance of agriculture, the largest sector of the Nigerian economy (accounting for more than one-ﬁfth of the total), which registered expansion of just 1.2%”. The report specifically said: “As with other parts of the private sector, the agriculture industry is keen to secure cheaper credit so as to stimulate growth, and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has suggested that it is working on a framework to introduce a “differentiated dynamic cash reserves requirement” to encourage bank lending to agriculture and other core sectors. “However, headwinds including the ongoing conﬂict over land between farmers and herders in the Middle Belt region will persist”. The report expects GDP to expand by 2.1% in 2018—a substantial improvement on the 2016-17 average of -0.4%, but less than half the 2010-15 average—before accelerating to 3.1% in 2019, giving the CBN slightly greater scope for monetary easing. While the Naira is broadly stable, demand pressures are increasing, which will disincentivise aggressive easing. On the interbank market the value of the naira depreciated by just 0.1% between August and September, to N306.35/USD. However, the gap with the parallel market remains substantial, with the naira depreciating by 0.3% to N361/USD over the same period. In addition, demand pressure in the foreign exchange market is leading to a drawdown in reserves. The 30-day moving average of external reserves decreased by 3.18%, from $45.84bn to $44.38bn, between end-August and end September. Higher international oil prices and stable domestic production—daily crude output increased by 4.9% from 1.65mb/d to 1.73mb/d between July and August 2018—should support the external reserves in the short term, but persistent capital ﬂight, reﬂecting rising yields in the US, will continue to exert downward pressure. “We see the CBN maintaining its policy rate at 14.00% for the rest of 2018 before cutting by a modest 100 basis points to 13.0% by the end of 2019”. The Monetary Policy Committee’s most recent statement maintained a hawkish tone, but suggested that the most likely policy option would be an increase in the CRR, rather than the Monetary Policy Rate. Such a rise is possible in Q418 should ﬁnancial market liquidity rise. In 2019, we continue to forecast a modest cut of the policy rate and possibly also of the CRR. Such a rate cut is very much against the emerging-market norm: a series of emerging markets have increased rates in 2018 tightened credit to offset inﬂation risks and currency weakness amid trade fears and a resurgent US dollar. However, Nigeria isn’t as vulnerable to broad emerging-market volatility. Credit growth remains weak, rising by just 0.3% month-on-month in August, and while this compares with a decline of 0.6% the previous month, it remains insuﬃcient to spur real GDP growth. A more substantial cut is unlikely, however, given that we expect inflation to remain well above the CBN’s targeted upper limit of 9.0%. SHOCKING STORY!!!
