Lagos – Austine Eguavoen, the former Super Eagles defender and coach, has been appointed Technical Director for Greek third division side, A.P.S Zakynthos, in a season-long deal. The 53-year-old revealed this in a monitored radio programme in Lagos, saying that he was contacted through a third party last season, and only recently reached a decision to become the club’s Technical Director and Head Coach after a more extensive discussion with the club president. Eguavoen said he was sold on the vision of the club and his main objective is to ensure promotion from the Gamma Ethniki. “I have seen them play. I watched an FA Cup match last week and the club won big. There are a few individually brilliant players and overall, the team is good. “My immediate objective ties with the club’s and I have that understanding with the president. We don’t want to be in the same league for more than a season and for me I like the flexibility of my role in the long term as Technical Director and Head Coach,” Eguavoen explained. Zakynthos have never played in the premier division of Greek football, but the club has a rich history, having been established since 1961 but they took a financial hit in recent seasons and suffered a slump that saw them drop to the fourth division, Delta Ethniki.
