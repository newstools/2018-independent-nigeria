Liverpool’s run to last season’s Champions League final earned them £72 million, more than double the total amassed from the tournament by Manchester United, figures released by UEFA have showed. Jurgen Klopp’s side lost 3-1 to Real Madrid, the top earners with £78m, in the final in Kiev. Beaten semifinalists Bayern Munich made £62.3m, and Roma were the tournament’s second-highest earners with £74.1m. United, who went out to Sevilla in the round of 16, made £35.3m, while Paris Saint-Germain, knocked out by Madrid at the same stage, got £54.9m. Manchester City, who reached the quarterfinals, picked up £56.5m, with fellow quarterfinalists Tottenham getting £54.2m and Juventus £70.9m. Chelsea, who lost to Barcelona at the same stage, made £57.7m, with Barca banking £50.8m despite going further than the Blues and reaching the quarterfinals. UEFA revealed that every club was guaranteed £11.27m for playing in the group stage, while performance bonuses of £1.3m for a win and £443,000 for a draw were paid out, with more bonuses paid for progression to each knockout round. Market pool funds, distributed in accordance with the proportional value of each television market represented by participating clubs, further topped up the totals.
