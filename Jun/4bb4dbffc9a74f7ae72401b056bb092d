Lagos – Nwankwo Kanu, former Super Eagles captain, has tipped Ahmed Musa, the Leicester City’s on-loan forward, to shine as the Super Eagles gear up for their sixth appearances at the World Cup, starting in Russia next week. Kanu was talking to Russian News Agency (TASS) where he explained that Musa, who is on loan to CSKA Moscow, struggled in the English football due to the fact that he signed for the Foxes at a difficult time, having just won the league. The Olympian said that Musa remained one of the leaders of the present Super Eagles, saying that he showed what he was capable of doing after his return to Russia, albeit on loan to his former club. “Musa is a very good player, his main asset, of course, is his speed,” Kanu told TASS. “As for his appearances for Leicester, he got into the team at a difficult moment, it was hard after they won the league, many changes followed. All this affected the career of Ahmed in England. Ahmed Musa makes his second CSKA Moscow debut in the Russian club’s goalless Europa League draw at Red Star Belgrade “But that does not mean that Musa is a bad player. I think he showed his level when he returned to Russia before the World Cup.” “I consider him one of the leaders of the Nigerian national team because he is already a very experienced player; he played and scored in the last World Cup. “In several games he was even the captain of the national team. The Nigerian team certainly needs such a player, he will help grow young players.’” comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
