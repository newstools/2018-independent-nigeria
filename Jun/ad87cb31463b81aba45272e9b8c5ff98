Lagos – Zlatko Dalic, the coach of Croatian national football team, has said that their match against the Teranga Lions of Senegal gave them the right recipe on what to expect from Nigeria when both countries clash in the Group B’s second match on Saturday, June 16. It will be recalled that Croatia had to come from a goal down to defeat the Africans in both countries’ last test match before their movement to Russia and the coach, who praised the Teranga Lions as “the best African team,” noted that it was the kind of match they had to play before facing the Super Eagles. He spoke to http://hns-cff.hr/en/, the official website of the Croatian Football Federation. “Congratulations to Senegal for a good performance, they are the best African team, with pacey players, quick transition, and quality defence. That was just the test we needed before the Nigeria encounter at the World Cup. “They gave us what to expect when we face Nigeria. In the first half, we distributed the ball too slowly, leaving us with no solutions. Later on, we corrected some things and performed better searching for an equalizer and the winner. “Croatia has to be happy to be leaving for Russia with a win, even though we need to improve even further, in order to open the FIFA World Cup with a positive result against Nigeria. I remain optimistic, while Croatia needs to learn a lesson, play faster and present more quality. In seven days, we have to be at our maximum level,” he said. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
