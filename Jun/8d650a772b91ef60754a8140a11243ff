The players of Korea Republic would have been engaged in a mandatory two-year military training, which the authorities in that country said was compulsory for all the able-bodied young man and woman but the fans of the national team had made passionate appeal to the prime minister, Lee Nak-yeon, to shelve the measure for the players. The appeal was sequel to the country’s elimination of Germany, the cup holders, from the tournament following a 2-0 win over the Europeans, which will go down as one of the greatest upsets in global football. The fans, who reacted through twitter, noted that the career of the players, which saw them beat the ‘Almighty’ Germany 2-0, should not be wasted in military training. South Korea’s loss to Mexico last week was a virtual knockout blow to the Asian nation’s chances of getting out of the group stage this year’s World Cup. Prime Minister, Nak-yeon, however, joined the fans, tweeting on Thursday: “Reality beat our imagination today” and praising the South Korean footballers. Dozens of online petitions were launched on the presidential website, urging the authorities to exempt star players, if not all of them, including Tottenham Hotspur forward Son and goalkeeper Cho Hyun-woo, from the mandatory two-year military service. “They gave us so much hope,” said one petitioner. “Their talent should not be wasted in the military!” According to a Korean media outlet, Dong-A daily, the authorities are seriously considering the plea from the fans to exempt virtually all the players from the exercise, even as the outlet was quoted as reporting that the prime minister was considering making the exercise optional. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
