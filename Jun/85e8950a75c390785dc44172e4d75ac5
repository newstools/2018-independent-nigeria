Ado-Ekiti – Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State has asked Kayode Fayemi, the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate in the July 14 governorship poll, to explain how he spent statutory allocations and other funds that accrued to his government between 2010 and 2014. Gboyega Oguntuase, chairman of Ekiti PDP, said documents from the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, the National Bureau of Statistics, among others, show that Fayemi collected a total of N165 billion as allocations, excluding regular funds from Excess Crude Account (ECA), grants, internally-generated revenue (IGR) among others, but Fayemi still took N25 billion bond and N35 billion commercial loans “with nothing to show” for the funds. The PDP chair, in a statement to journalists in Ado-Ekiti on Sunday, claimed that the Ayodele Fayose administration had done creditably despite the lean resources at its disposal. “In 2011, Fayemi got N40.5 billion as monthly statutory allocations; in 2012, he got N39.8 billion; in 2013, he got N44.3 billion and in 2014, he got N40.1 billion.” On the flipside, Ekiti Recovery Movement (ERM) has expressed concern over the non-disclosure of funds generated through the IGR by the administration of Governor Ayodele Fayose in Ekiti. The group also accused the governor of misappropriating N251.99 billion that accrued from federal allocation and IGR since 2014. Olalekan Soyombo, coordinator of the group, said available statistics from the Federal Ministry of Finance revealed that Ekiti had received an aggregate of N223.99 billion as allocation in the last 43 months after tax and debt deductions, querying why Fayose had found it difficult to pay salaries and pensions for the past eight months. Soyombo said it was so pathetic that the state has made an aggregate of N17.2 billion on an average of N400 million monthly under Fayose as IGR, lamenting that the governor allegedly kept the accrual secret. He said: “Putting the IGR and federal allocation together in the last 43 months, the PDP government has managed N251.19 billion, outside the Paris Club refunds, capital funds, 13 month budget support funds, excess crude account among others that this government got under President Muhammadu Buhari’s government.” But Oguntuase argued that the Fayose administration got N28.2 billion in 2015, N18.8 billion in 2016 and N25.6 billion in 2017. “Apart from the monthly allocations, Fayemi still got regular funds from the Excess Crude Oil Account, IGR among others. “Despite what Fayemi got, he still borrowed N25 billion from the capital market and took N31 billion commercial loans. The question is, what did he do with the money? Nothing. “The N25 billion bond and commercial loans, through which he mortgaged the finances of our dear state for 20 years, were spent on nothing.” 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
