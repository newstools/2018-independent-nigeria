A man has been charged after he allegedly slashed another man with a machete after they had an argument in the NSW Northern Tablelands. Two men, aged 30 and 33, are said to have argued at an Armidale petrol station in the early hours of Sunday morning before leaving in separate vehicles. It is alleged the 33-year-old then went to the other manâ€™s house a short while later where the 30-year-old opened the door and struck him with a machete, cutting him on the throat. The 33-year-old later had surgery. The 30-year-old was arrested and charged with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He was refused bail and is due to appear at Armidale Local Court on Monday. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
