According to sources, the kidnappers struck between Kiryoyi and Maganda villages of Birnin Gwari local government area. SATURDAY INDEPENDENT learnt that they reportedly stopped vehicles carrying passengers and ordered the people into the bush. According to the source who said he spoke to the chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in Birnin Gwari, Danladi Duniya, said the NURTW boss confirmed the incident in a telephone interview. “I am not in a position to say precisely the number of people abducted, but they are many.
