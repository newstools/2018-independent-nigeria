Last week, I forgot to congratulate the vice president of Silverbird Group on his new appointment. Guy Murray-Bruce was appointed the Special Adviser on Entertainment and Tourism to the Governor of Bayelsa State, the Honourable Henry Seriake Dickson, two weeks ago. Guy is one of those who placed the Silverbird Empire on the pedestal it stands today. Murray-Bruce studied Business Administration at the California State University and graduated in 1995. He oversees the local and international operations of the Silverbird Group of Companies, which comprises Silverbird Communications Limited (STV and Rhythm FM); Silverbird Cinemas (Nigeria, Ghana and Liberia); Silverbird Film Distribution (W.A) Limited and Silverbird Properties Limited. His appointment is a welcome one as Bayelsa has a lot of untapped assets in terms of tourism. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
