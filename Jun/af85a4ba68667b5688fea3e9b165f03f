Born in the 1980’s in the Paris suburbs, this huge underground music enthusiast, originally coming from the Hip-Hop and scratch scene, is well accustomed to the big stages and could be found behind the decks in the mid-2000’s. The variety of formats that he flawlessly conveys music through is dominated by a predilection for vinyl records, which he has been collecting since his young age. Alexis belongs to a generation of artists building on over a decade of experience in their field. Combining influences from Detroit and Chicago, the sound that defines him reflects his early and endless fascination for the sharpest percussions. The always widening range of inspirations Alexis puts forward bears witness to the fruitful musical exploration he has been passionately leading over the years. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
