Lagos – Nigeria plans to sell N1.05 trillion worth of treasury bills in seven auctions in the third quarter of 2018, according to the Central Bank of Nigeria’s Treasury Bills Issuance Calendar. Specifically, the CBN would offer N44.86 billion in the three-month papers, N225.08 billion in the six-month bills and N782.47 billion in the one-year notes. The planned treasury bills auction of N1.05 trillion in Q3 2018 represent 8.92 per cent increase over the N964.47 billion the CBN issued in the second quarter of 2018, and 13.5 per cent decrease from the N1.214 trillion issued in Q1 2017. The bank issues treasury bills twice a month to help the government to finance its budget deficit, curb money supply growth and provide an avenue for lenders to manage liquidity. Early in May, the CBN released its Monetary, Credit, Foreign Trade and Exchange Policy Guidelines for Fiscal Years 2018/2019, wherein settlement banks were directed to provide clearing collateral of not less than N15 billion in treasury bills to enable them to perform settlement roles. Meanwhile, contrary to forecasts that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s Treasury Bills’ slowdown would impact the financial performance of deposit money banks (DMBs), an analysis of 2018 first quarter results of lenders show that they continue to be boosted by interest income from investment in securities as well as higher yields from loan and advances to customers. For instance analysis of  ten banks’ first quarter results show that their total interest income for the first three months of the year increased to N592.42 billion from N531.88 billion in the corresponding period last year. Findings indicate that out of the ten banks, Guaranty Trust Bank and Diamond Bank were the only lenders that reported a decline in interest income in the period under review. Indeed, both lenders only reported marginal decline in their interest income for the first quarter with Guaranty Trust Bank’s result showing a four per cent decline from the N84 billion it posted in Q1 of 2017 to N80. 78 billion this year, while Diamond Bank recorded a one per cent decline from N38.65 billion in the first three months of 2017 to N38.13 billion this year. Another Tier 2 lender, Wema Bank, reported a 1.6 per cent increase in interest income to N12.65 billion in the first quarter of this year from N12.45 billion it reported in the same period last year. Also, Fidelity Bank reported a 6.2 per cent rise in interest income to N38.47 billion in Q1 2018 compared with N36 billion it recorded in 2017. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
