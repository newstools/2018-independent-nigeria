Vienna has been discussed as a possible venue for a summit between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, the Kremlin said Saturday. Speaking in China, where Putin was attending a regional security summit, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the two presidents discussed “the need for such a meeting” And the possibility that it could take place in the Austrian capital in their most recent phone call. According to White House statements, Trump last spoke to Putin on March 20. the possibility of a Vienna summit was also raised this week during talks in the city between Putin and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who has sought to present his country as a bridge between Russia and the West. However, Peskov also stressed that no specific agreement had been reached about holding a summit between Trump and Putin. Since the two presidents’ conversation in March, relations between Moscow and the West have worsened, particularly after the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the UK, which prompted Western countries to expel Russian diplomats. But Trump on Friday called on world leaders to allow Russia back into the G7, the group of leading industrialized democracies. In an interview on Saturday with Russian state TV, Putin said he has found Trump to be a “thoughtful man” and believes “dialogue can be constructive” between the two. He also said he hopes to improve Russian-American relations. “We are ready for this,” he said. “The ball, I believe … [is] on the American court.” 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
