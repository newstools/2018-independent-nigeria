Germany coach Joachim Low is not about to rip up his team’s blueprint for success.Defending champions are looking to recover from a shock defeat to Mexico in their opening match at the 2018 World Cup on Sunday. Hirving Lozano’s goal in the 35th minute proved enough to hand El Tri a hard-earned victory, during which defender Mats Hummels felt Germany’s offensive approach had often left him and Jerome Boateng exposedDespite the negative headlines back home, Low is not about to hit the panic button as the squad aims to regroup ahead of their second Group F fixture against Sweden in Sochi on June 23. “Throw out the game plan? We certainly do not do that,” Low said in an interview on the German federation’s official website, www.dfb.de. “If we do the things we do well, then we can achieve a lot. “(Against Mexico), everyone came and wanted to grab the ball, so we have to improve that and to rediscover our strength.Only Spain, in 2010, have gone on to lift the trophy after losing an opening match, while three of the last four world champions have failed to progress to the knockout stages. Low, however, sees no reason for Die Mannschaft to suffer the same fate as they aim to make it back to the Luzhniki Stadium for the final on July 15. “We will not fall to pieces,” he said. “We will make it (out of the group). We have every opportunity to correct things, but we have to make things right.” comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
