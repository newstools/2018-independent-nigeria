A Mayoral candidate was killed in Mexico on Thursday, becoming the second to be assassinated within 24 hours in the run-up to elections on July 1, officials said. Michoacan State Governor, Silvano Aureoles, confirmed on Twitter the killing of Fernando Angeles Juarez, from the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), in Ocampo at about 180 kilometres west of Mexico City. The news agency Quadratin said Juarez was shot dead at his home by three men who fled. His assassination followed that of Omar Gomez Lucatero, who was running for mayor in Aguililla in Michoacan. More than 40 aspiring candidates have been killed in Mexico since last September, according to the risk analysis company Etellekt. The PRD called on the authorities to protect candidates and to punish those responsible for the killings. Voters will elect a president as well as lawmakers, senators, governors and mayors. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
