IBADAN – Pastor Isaiah Olaoluwatoyi Alade, the District Superintendent of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Prayer Mountain of Mercy, (Ori-Oke Aanun), Ibadan has called on the people of Ekiti and Osun States to pray against violence during the forthcoming governorship elections. Pastor Alade, who made this call in an interview with newsmen in Ibadan, also appealed to political gladiators in the two states to shun violence before, during and after the governorship elections. He advised the people to seek the face of God in choosing their governors during the polls. Alade also used the opportunity to call on the President Mohammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration to do everything possible to foster love among Nigerians. He also called on the Federal Government to invest recovered loots in sectors that will make life more meaningful to Nigerians, for the ongoing anti corruption crusade to have meaning to the people of the country. 2 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
