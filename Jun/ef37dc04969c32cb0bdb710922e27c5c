Lagos – Trading was for four days last week as the Federal Government of Nigeria declared Friday June 15, 2018 and Monday June 18, 2018 public holidays to mark the end of the Holy month of Ramadan and commemorate the Eid-al-Fitr celebrations. The bullish trend in the domestic bourse was extended as the NSE All Share Index (ASI) rose 0.7 per cent week-on-week to settle at 38,928.47 points while year-to-date return strengthened to 1.8 per cent. A total turnover of 1.738 billion shares worth N18.462 billion in 14,790 deals were traded last week by investors on the floor of the Exchange in contrast to a total of 1.749 billion shares valued at N31.183 billion that exchanged hands last week in 24,604 deals. The financial services Industry (measured by volume) led the activity chart with 1.170 billion shares valued at N9.695 billion traded in 7,809 deals; thus contributing 67.35 per cent and 52.51 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively. The services industry followed with 293.492 million shares worth N733.407 million in 531 deals. The third place was occupied by consumer goods with a turnover of 154.093 million shares worth N4.997 billion in 3,002 deals. This positive performance was largely driven by bargain hunting in Nestle Nigeria (+4.5%), Stanbic IBTC (+3.2%) and Seplat Petroleum Development Company (+2.7%). As a result, investors gained N150.9 billion as market capitalisation rose to N14.0 trillion. However, activity level was mixed as average volume traded improved 24.1per cent to 434.2 million units while average value traded weakened by 28.6 per cent to N4.5 billion Week-on-Week. The top traded stocks by volume were Ikeja Hotel (280.3m), United Bank for Africa (189.1m) and Africa Prudential (179.4m) while Guaranty Trust Bank (N3.3bn), United Bank for Africa (N2.1bn) and Dangote Sugar Refinery (N1.9bn) were the top traded stocks by value. The local bourse began the week on a bullish note as the ASI advanced 0.5 per cent and 0.8 per cent on Monday and Tuesday respectively on the back of gains in Guaranty Trust Bank , FBN Holdings, Nigerian Breweries, Dangote Cement, Nestle Nigeria and Seplat Petroleum Development Company. However, by midweek, this upward trend was reversed as the benchmark index shed 0.3 per cent on Wednesday before further declining 0.3 per cent on Thursday as investors took profit in market bellwethers ahead of the holiday season. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
