Three Turkish soldiers were killed Sunday in an attack by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in the extreme southeastern Hakkari province neighbouring Iraq, state-run Anadolu news agency said. The soldiers had been protecting a road building team in the Daglica district of the province close to the Iraqi border, it added. One soldier was wounded in the attack, which was carried out by a guided rocket, it said. The authorities are still battling the three-decade insurgency of the PKK which initially took up arms for a separate state but now demands more autonomy. Ankara backed peace talks in the early years of the decade but a ceasefire collapsed in 2015 and there have been deadly clashes ever since. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
