A fire has hit Iraq’s biggest ballot paper warehouse that was being used to store votes ahead of a recount. Votes for the eastern district of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, were being held in the building. It is not clear if voting papers have been destroyed or what caused the fire in the storage centre. Last month’s legislative elections were won by an alliance headed by the populist Shia cleric, Moqtada Sadr. Amid allegations of widespread fraud, on Wednesday Iraq’s parliament requested a manual recount of around 10 million votes cast. Firefighters were attempting to control the fire at the storage site, which housed ballot boxes of the al-Rusafa district in the east of Baghdad. An interior ministry spokesman told the Reuters news agency that the blaze had destroyed some documents and equipment, but efforts were being made to stop it from affecting ballot boxes. However, Baghdad province council member, Mohamed al-Rabeei, told Reuters that “all the boxes and papers have burned”. On Tuesday, Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, warned that security agencies had evidence of “unprecedented” violations. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
