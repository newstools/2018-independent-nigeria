Lagos – The Executive Secretary of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), Obafemi Olawore, has retired from the organisation after 17 years in its service. Having mounted the saddle as the first Executive Secretary of MOMAN at a time of great uncertainty, Olawore was able to advance the objectives of the organisation, while championing its position at major policy dialogue sessions. At a newsmen in Lagos recently, the new Executive Secretary of MOMAN, Clement Isong, stated that Olawore oversaw the affairs of MOMAN for 17 years. MOMAN is an industry group comprising all the major players in Nigeria’s downstream oil and gas industry which include Total, 11Plc (formerly Mobil Oil Nigeria), Conoil, Forte Oil, OVH Energy and MRS. “It is on record that Olawore acquitted himself well on the job, liaising with all the major regulatory organizations such as DPR, PPPRA, PEF and others supervising the operations of the downstream sector as well as forging alliances with other industry groups on critical industry positions. “A firm believer on the need for a deregulated downstream as opposed to operating in a subsidy regime where the government dictates prices, Olawore believes that Nigeria needs to borrow from successful markets and competitive models where the market dictates prices and competition raises value and innovation to the benefit of the consumer,” he said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
