Super Eagles hope of qualifying for the second round of the ongoing World Cup in Russia depends on winning their remaining two group games against Iceland and Argentina, following their 2-0 loss to Croatia in their group opening match on Saturday. An Oghenekaro Etebo 32nd minute own goal and 71st minute penalty converted by Lucas Modric was all that Croatia needed to grab the three points at stake. And as noticed in their friendly games, the two goals were conceded off set pieces (corner kicks) that have become the team’s Achilles Heels. Super Eagles failure to clear the 32nd minute corner allowed a Croatian striker, Mario Mandzukic , to head the ball on the six yard box, though the ball was going out, it hit Etebo’s leg and diverted it to for an own goal. The second also followed same pattern. A corner kick from the left flank, though cleared, but William Troost-Ekong was all over Mandzukic, including arms around the neck, and the referee made no mistake pointing to the spot. With this victory, Croatia now top group D with three points, while Argentina and Iceland that played 1-1 earlier in the day are tied on second. Super Eagles greatest undoing was poor marking. While the Croatians charge our players all over the field, same is not replicated by Super Eagles players as they allow the Croatian attackers enough space to operate. “It’s sad that we lost. I know we can do better. Hope is not lost yet, I still believe things can still change,” said Austin Okocha, former Super Eagles captain on SuperSport. “These Croatians are world class players. This is the little details that are missing in our team.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
