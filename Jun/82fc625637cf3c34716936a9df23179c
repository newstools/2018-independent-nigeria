One of my favourite first ladies is that of Benue State. She is known for her selflessness and also an inspiration to young ladies of the state. During the week, Dr. Mrs Eunice Ortom was at the”First Inspire the Lady Project which was put together by Love Idoko, the renowned motivational and inspirational speaker. The sole aim of the event which is to Coach, mentor and inspire women to maximise their potentials and increase their capability and ability to do and be more was held at the Dream Centre Markurdi, the Benue State Capital. Dr. Mrs. Ortom, while addressing the attendees at the event, indicated hope that the project will serve as a vehicle that will help ladies take their destiny into their own hands and do what’s right. She also described the convener of the event, Love Idoko, as an inspiration and a shining example to others especially those who humbly imbibe what they have learnt under her tutelage. Other Guests and keynote speakers at the opening session were Evang. Lydia Idoko, President Faith Women Fellowship Ministries Int’l;  Hon Ngunan Addingi, member Benue State House of Assembly; Pst Abel Uloko, Resident Pastor House on the Rock Makurdi; and Arch Nguvan Kyenge, CEO Lush Events. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
