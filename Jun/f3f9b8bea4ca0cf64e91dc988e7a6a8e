Many cynical youths have been heard saying, “school is overrated.” It’s all funny and causes a great many to laugh until you come across a young boy of school age, with developed language skills, speaking his mother tongue fluently and expertly without being able to speak a sentence of English Language, Nigeria’s lingua franca and the official language used to teach in all Nigerian schools. This is the story of the five year old Taju who became an instant online celebrity because of the level of impoverishment that prevented him from going to school as displayed in a funny but sad video where he tried to answer a simple question in English. Since his discovery by Nollywood actress, Funmi Awelewa, many celebs have pitched in to fund little Taju’s education. The cute Yoruba kid drew the sympathy of celebrities like Ay Makun and Don Jazzy, among others. Already, plans are in place to send the bold, smart and intelligent boy to school to get the learning he needs. Comments @olaideolona: He’s so smart and sharp @kariscollections: Very smart and funny boy. I am sure he will do well in school. @deollycious: He said, “Mi o mo how old are you.” Even without going to school he is intelligent #TajuMustGoToSchool @upcloseandclassy: I see a genius in Taju. He is so smart, everyone can see it. Also very cheerful and full of life! comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
