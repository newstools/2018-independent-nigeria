WARRI  – Bernard Oyabavwe, a Warri-based lawyer, has petitioned Ibrahim Magu, the chairman, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), over the alleged obstruction of justice and arrest his client, Nosa Igiehon, during a court session. According to Oyabavwe, Igiehon who was standing trial at the Warri Magistrate Court on June 5, 2018 was attacked and whisked away by EFCC operatives. In the petition copies of which were sent to the Attorney-General of the Federation and the Inspector General of Police, Oyabavwe urged Magu to order the release of his client. “Prior to this time, our client (Nosa)  had been arrested by the police and taken through all formations of the police command in this zone until he was finally charged to court on a holding charge and remanded in prison custody pending the rendering  of legal advice by the director of public  prosecution,” he said. He contended that Igiehon was released on bail by a Warri High Court pending the filing of information or trial at the High Court by the Director of the Public Prosecution, “but, to our greatest surprise, my client who was already in court waiting for his case to be called, was forcefully arrested and whisked away by the EFCC operatives, who refused to give us information over their action. Contending that the complainant, Edwin Okhomina’s case was the same thing he had earlier presented before the commission, Oyabavwe pleaded that his client be released unconditionally to face his case, which was already in magistrate court. “In this circumstance, we demand that since the police has concluded their investigations into this matter and charged our client, he should be released forthwith from your custody in order to stand for his trial and for justice to run its course,” he stressed. 2 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
