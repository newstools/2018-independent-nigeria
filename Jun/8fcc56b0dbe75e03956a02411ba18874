LAFIA – Mdzough U Tiv (MUT) in Nasarawa State has cried out over what it refers to as continuous attacks and killings by suspected Fulani herdsmen in the state and beyond. Thomas Gaar, the interim president of Mdzough U Tiv in Nasarawa, said this on Thursday. Gaar noted that over 230 Tiv farmers had been murder by Fulani herders on different coordinated attacks, saying that the attack is genocidal in nature, and also an ethnic cleansing of Tiv people in the southern senatorial district of the state. Gaar, who said this in a press briefing in Lafia, the state capital, said that from January to date, properties worth billions of naira were destroyed leaving over 500,000 Tiv farmers displaced. He lamented, saying: “What can we say?, where do we go? Who will save us from this coordinated genocide and ethnic cleansing our eyes are witnessing and swollen with heavy tears. Nasarawa State government should please hear us and step up.” He also stressed that they had hoped coming of Vice President Yemi Osinbanjo to Nasarawa State would bring permanent solutions to the mayhem, but expressed dismay as the visit failed to yield any positive result, even as he revealed that the Killings continued unabated. The MUT president, who pledge allegiance to Nasarawa State as their only home land, “We have no other places than Nasarawa State; we are here and prepared to salvage and partner with other ethnic groups as we have always done to help the development of our dear state,” he said. Gaar, who cried of disenfranchisement of Tiv people in the state, appeal to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to organise a special voters registration for Tiv people at the IDPs camps in the state to enable them exercise their civic right in the forthcoming general election. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
