Barrister Solomon Dalung has described Nigeria’s 1-2 loss to Argentina on Tuesday as unfortunate. The Minister of Youth and Sports who led Federal Government’s delegation to cheer the Super Eagles in their last Group D match said the team blew its chances of beating Argentina and qualifying for a possible second round. “I wish to apologize for disappointing Nigerians by our early exit, leaving many football loving fans devastated. We know the passion and football followership of Nigerians but it is unfortunate that we couldn’t make it even to the next round. “The players did their best in this game but the technical glitches cost us a second round ticket.  How we couldn’t hold the ball for the last five mins is still a shock to us”. He attributed the loss to poor game management on the part of the technical crew and inexperience of the young team.  He said that the team will need more experience in future from a more technically sound tactician. “I have interacted with Nigerians here in Russia and it appears the technical crew could not manage the 1-1 draw with just five minutes left. “It is time to go back to the technical committee and technical department for future assignments. The technical crew cannot work independent of the NFF’s technical committee and department.” The Minister advised that attention must now be turned to the Africa Cup of Nations Qualifiers as he urged the NFF to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the team qualifies for the tournament. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
