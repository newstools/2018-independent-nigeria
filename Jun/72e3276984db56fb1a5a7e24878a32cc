Osogbo – Family of the late Senator Isiaka Adeleke has accused the Osun State government of politicising his death and arraignment of the nurse that allegedly administered drugs on him. The family, in a statement signed by Deji Adeleke, younger brother of the late senator, said the sudden re-arrest and prosecution of Alfred Aderibigbe, the nurse that reportedly administered drugs on him before his death, was to politicise the death of their brother. It warned the state government to stop politicising the matter and allow their brother to rest in peace, stressing that the government’s action was to continue to ridicule the family. The state High Court, sitting in Ede, on Friday, June 8, ordered that the nurse be remanded in prison custody. Aderibigbe had earlier been indicted by the coroner inquest led by Magistrate Olusegun Ayilara, for allegedly administering overdose of drugs on the late senator. But he pleaded not guilty to the murder charge preferred against him in the court. The Ayilara-led coroner inquest, in its report, recommended that the nurse be prosecuted, having established that he administered a drug overdose on the late senator leading to his death. However, the family, in the statement, said the sudden re-arrest and prosecution of Aderibigbe was an attempt by the state government to cover up the truth behind Adeleke’s death. The family further said they were not carried along in the prosecution of the nurse, adding that the report of the coroner panel and autopsy report carried out at Ladoke Akintola University of Technology Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, was not made available to the family by both the government and the hospital. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
