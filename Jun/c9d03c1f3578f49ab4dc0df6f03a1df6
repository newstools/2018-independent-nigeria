Former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Danny Kirwan has died. His death was reported by Mick Fleetwood via Facebook.In a tribute headed “Danny Kirwan May 13, 1950 – June 8, 2018”, Fleetwood wrote, “Today was greeted by the sad news of the passing of Danny Kirwan in London, England. Danny was a huge force in our early years. His love for the Blues led him to being asked to join Fleetwood Mac in 1968, where he made his musical home for many years. “Danny’s true legacy, in my mind, will forever live on in the music he wrote and played so beautifully as a part of the foundation of Fleetwood Mac that has now endured for over fifty years. “Thank you, Danny Kirwan. You will forever be missed! “~Mick Fleetwood and Fleetwood Mac” The cause of death is unknown at this time. Danny Kirwan joined Fleetwood Mac in 1968 after his band Boilerhouse supported Fleetwood Mac and impressed the band’s producer Mike Vernon and frontman Peter Green. When Boilerhouse fell apart, Mick Fleetwood convinced Green that Kirwan should join Fleetwood Mac, creating a three guitar line-up with Green and Jeremy Spencer. Kirwan’s first recorded work with the band was Albatross, Fleetwood Mac’s only UK number 1. Peter Green had been struggling to finish the song. With the arrival of Kirwan, everything fell into place. Green commented later, “I would never have done Albatross if it wasn’t for Danny. I would never have had a number one hit record.” Kirwan’s composition Jigsaw Puzzle Blues was the B-side – despite being the new boy, he played all the guitar parts himself. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
