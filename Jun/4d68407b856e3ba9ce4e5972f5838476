Hip-Hop beef is at an all-time high right now and it’s simply amazing. The recent feud between Pusha T and Drake seems to have energized much of Hip-Hop. Most of the feud has been left to the music as the Rappers both released stellar diss records. Drake released “Duppy Freestyle” as a response to “Infrared,” a record from Pusha T’s latest album “Daytona”. I would credit “Infared,” “The Story of Adidon” Pusha T’s follow up diss record and the phenomenal production on “Daytona” for being one of the reasons much of Hip-Hop journeyed to Wyoming recently for Kanye West’s “Ye” album listening session. In my opinion, many people were intrigued and wanted to know what helped spark the creation of these records. Pusha T has been the talk of the music world since releasing his official Drake response record. After releasing “Duppy Freestyle,” Drake took a shot a Pusha T by sending his manager Steven Victor a $20,000 invoice for services rendered. Of course it was in a joking manner, but Rappin’ 4 Tay saw the invoice and decided to have his own fun. He did so by sending Drake a voice for ghostwriting services for the single “Who Do You Love.” The invoice was sent because Drake borrowed some of 4 Tay’s bars for the produced record. Of course it all was done in a jokingly manner, but you have to laugh at the irony. We’re all waiting for the next Drake response record, but right now it looks as if he’s waiting for the right time. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
