Lagos – Victor Moses, Super Eagles forward, has assured that the team would fight for win in their remaining games in the ongoing World Cup in Russia. He gave this assurance following the team’s 2-0 loss to Croatia in their group opening game on Saturday. Moses, while reacting through his twitter handle, noted that the result was disappointing but assured that they would dust themselves for the challenges ahead. ‘’Disappointed with the result last night but we win together and lose together and will dust ourselves down and be ready to fight again. We are working hard to put things right #SuperEagles,’’ Moses posted on Twitter. Nigeria will playIceland on Friday in a must win match. Debutants, Iceland, pulled a shock 1-1 draw with Argentina, and will likely carry similar atmosphere into the game against Nigeria. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
