Somalia has launched a new education curriculum for primary schools across the country to ensure access to quality education for its youthful population. Hassan Ali, the Director General of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Higher Education said the new curriculum will be implemented in the new academic year that begins in August. “We hope this new curriculum will make a positive input into the education of the Somali children,” Ali said in a statement released by the AU Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) on Tuesday. The new curriculum was announced as part of celebrations to mark International Day of the African Child held in Mogadishu where the government vowed to work closely with development partners to ensure access to quality education for its youthful population. “The curriculum will be adopted for use in schools across the country, whether they are private schools or public schools,” said Ali. He said children in Somalia have a right to education like their counterparts in other African countries, noting that the government will work tirelessly to ensure its population is well educated. Ali described education as the cornerstone for Somalia’s development, urging ministries and government institutions to work together to improve schooling after decades of conflict. The International Day of the African Child is marked every year on June 16 and this year’s theme “leave no child behind for Africa’s development” is aimed at creating awareness on the importance of protecting the rights of children and ensuring both boys and girls have equal opportunities. UN says three million children in the country are missing school. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
