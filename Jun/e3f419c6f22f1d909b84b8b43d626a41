President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick has assured that heartfelt disappointment over elimination from the FIFA World Cup finals has given way to fresh determination of ensuring qualification for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. “Our expectation was for a place in the knockout rounds but that didn’t happen. We will go home and prepare harder for the next finals. In truth, ours is a young and vibrant team capable of learning and getting better, and these attributes hold that the future is bright.” “For the moment, we have to start preparations for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, which is only 12 months away, as well as intensify the preparation of the Falconets (U20 Women Team) and the Super Falcons (Senior Women Team) for major championships coming up soon.” The U20 girls will participate in the 9th FIFA U20 Women’s World Cup taking place in France 7th – 26th August, while eight –time African champions Super Falcons have qualified for the 11th Women Africa Cup of Nations taking place later this year. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
