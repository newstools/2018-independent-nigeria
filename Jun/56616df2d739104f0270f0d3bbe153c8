Elder Moses Uba Kalu, founder, Empowerment and Transformational leadership forum (ETLEF) and National Coordinator, Christian Welfare Forum (CWI), has expressed that there is nothing wrong with having the position of the vice president conceded to women. For this to be, the elder in the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), said it was important that any woman who occupies the position pass the test of being distinct and strong willed. “There is nothing wrong with having a woman as the Vice-president of the country because we now have women that are educated and some that have distinguished themselves. “Okonji Iweala is one who did very well and distinguished herself. Dora Akunyili also did very well and many others so there is nothing wrong about that,” he stated. Welcoming the request form Nigerian female parliamentarians, he said that: “Yes I support their plea but the person has to be tested to know if the person is not someone who can be easily convinced by international bodies to save the nation. “Because the person who wishes to be the president of Nigeria must be a strong-willed person someone who cannot be easily turned around and not somebody who can be enticed but someone who is determined and focused. “So the person must be properly screened to know her background and connection so it doesn’t tell on Nigeria.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
