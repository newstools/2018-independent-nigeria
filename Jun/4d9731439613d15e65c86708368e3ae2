Lagos – The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has expressed displeasure over the unsettling activities of some Value Added Service (VAS) providers in the country. The commission recently warned that any provider that forcefully subscribes consumers to any Value Added Service without their consent will be slammed with N5 million fine. VAS is a popular telecommunications industry term for non-core services or services beyond standard voice calls. However, it can be used in any service industry for little or no cost. The NCC Head of Zonal Operations, Helen Obi, made this known recently, at the Consumers Conversation Forum held Karu Local Government Area, Nassarawa State. She said the commission on May 21 issued a directive to all network providers to desist from carrying out automatic or unwarranted renewal of data packages without their consent and forcefully subscribe consumers to the VAS services. Obi said the penalty for forcefully subscribing consumers to the VAS service without their consent would attract a fine of N5 million for any service provider who defaults the directive. She said: “The service provider is supposed to pay N5 million for default and for every day that the commission imposes that sanction and the fine are not paid; it will attract additional N500, 000. “And they should not forcefully subscribe consumers to any VAS without the express written consent obtained from that consumer”. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
