A fisherman has been mauled to death by a hippopotamus at Hamukungu landing site near Lake George in Lake Katwe sub-county Kasese District. Mr Lawrence Bafera, a renowned fisherman at the landing site, had gone to dry his fish where he was attacked by a hippopotamus. Mr John Ngango and Brain Ayesiga – all residents of the area – attributed these attacks to poor management by the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) whom they say have failed to control the wild animals in the Queen Elizabeth Conservation area. In Kasese district, wild animals have become a challenge to the communities after attacking people’s gardens, domestic animals and at times taking lives. According to the chairperson for Hamukungu, Mr David Ndahura, UWA has only given Shs200,000 as assistance to the deceased’s family. Ms Grace Asiimwe, the wife to the deceased has cried out to government for help since her late husband was the family’s bread winner. The body of Bafera has been taken to his ancestral home in Rubirizi District for burial.
By press time, we could not get a comment from UWA as the in charge of Queen Elizabeth Conservation area, Mr Edward Asalu was not in office and his phone was off. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
