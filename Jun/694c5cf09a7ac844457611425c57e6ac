OWERRI – The United States of America has indicated interest to assist Nigeria to achieve a fair, free and credible election in 2019. The US Consulate General, Lagos, stated this while speaking through Joan Mower, the facilitator of a two-day election reporting workshop for some journalists in Enugu. Mower said that with the increasing transformation of western technology, coupled with global security challenges, monitoring and dissemination of information had become crucial in sustaining world democracy. According to her, the United States Consulate General in liaison with the Voice of America (VOA) had taken up the challenge to provide refresher courses for practising journalists to update their knowledge for proper election coverage. She blamed media professionals for the failure to expose some of the ills that marred the US 2016 presidential election. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
