Super Eagles players have confirmed receiving their bonuses, ahead of the 2018 World Cup, which kicks off June 14. A cross section of the players confirmed the payments to KweséESPN, although they declined to go on record. “Yes, we have been paid,” one member of the squad confirmed. “Some of us who have accounts in England collected cash and paid it into their accounts by themselves. “The rest of us just got bank transfers.” In November, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) signed an agreement with the players on a pay structure for bonuses, allowances and a share of the income from participation at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Under the agreement, the players were to be paid their qualification bonuses and share of the FIFA income in advance and are also due 30% of the NFF’s appearance fee from FIFA, which amounts to $2.8million. FIFA made an advance payment of $2 million, while the NFF say they raised $800,000 from sponsorship. Each player got $10,000 per World Cup qualifying game, while head coach Gernot Rohr will be paid $15,000 per game and his assistants get $10,000 per game. Nigeria begin their World Cup campaign against Croatia on June 16 in Kaliningrad, before facing Iceland on June 22 and then Argentina on June 26. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
