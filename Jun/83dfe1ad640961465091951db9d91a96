AKURE – Olusanmi Mayowa, a man who stole and attempted to sell a vehicle belonging to his brother, has been arrested by men of the Ondo State Police Command. Niyi Akintoye, Tunde John and Olaoke Paul, who conspired with Mayowa to steal the Nissan Almera car with Reg No AKR 898 XA, have also been arrested. The state Commissioner of Police, Gbenga Adeyanju, said the four men were arrested following intelligence report. Adeyanju said Mayowa reported at Igbaraoke Police Station, Ifedore Local Government Area, that the vehicle was snatched from him by some armed men who tied his hands and legs. He said the suspect told the police that the vehicle was snatched between Igbara-Oke and Owena-Owode expressway. The police boss, however, said after thorough investigation, Mayowa confessed to the crime which led to the arrest of three other suspects. The suspect, confessing to reporters, said he planned with one of his friends, Niyi Akintoye, to tie his hands and legs inside the forest to serve as an alibi in the stealing of his brother’s car. He also explained that one of his mechanics in Akure, Tunde John, introduced him to one of his colleagues in Lokoja, Kogi State, who promised to sell the car. Mayowa explained that he came back to Ondo State after dropping the car with Olaoke John who promised to find a buyer for the car at the sum of N150,000. He said he reported the case at the police station immediately he returned from Lokoja but the detectives from the State Criminal Investigative Department were able to unravel the ploy. “It was the work of the devil. I don’t know why I decided to sell off my brother’s car which is my source of daily income. “My brother has been helping me with the car but I can’t explain what came over me,” he said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
