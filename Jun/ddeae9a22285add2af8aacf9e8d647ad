 According to a new report, Rihanna is no longer seeing Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel. MediaTakeOut News claims that Rihanna called off her rumoured relationship with the billionaire, because she “gets tired of men sometimes.” Whether or not this is the actual reason for the break-up remains to be seen, but it’s pretty relatable, nonetheless. The site’s source also alleges that “Rihanna and him were together for a while,” but that it was the Fenty Beauty creator that ended the relationship. Per MediaTakeOut News: “It was a good relationship, but now it’s over. Of course Rihanna broke his heart. That’s what she does: break[s] men’s hearts. Rihanna just got tired of him. She gets tired of men sometimes.” Arguably, the makeup mogul’s career is entering an incredibly busy period right now, with the release of Ocean’s 8, in which she co-stars alongside Cate Blanchett and Sandra Bullock, the launch of her lingerie line, Savage x Fenty, and the continued success of her makeup collection, Fenty Beauty. Maybe Rihanna just doesn’t have all that much time to date. Jameel is a Toyota heir, as well as a Saudi Arabian businessman. Rumours that Rihanna was dating Jameel started circulating in June 2017, when they were spotted making out in a pool in Spain. Shortly after that they were seen on a date in Ibiza, seeming to confirm the new coupling. In July 2017, a source revealed that Rihanna and Jameel had already “been hooking up for a few months.” 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
