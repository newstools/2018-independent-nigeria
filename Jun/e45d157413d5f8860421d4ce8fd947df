Bauchi state Chairman of a non-governmental organisation, Change Women Association (CHAWA), Mrs Maryam Alexander, has called on political parties and government at all levels to increase women’s involvement in decision making in the country.
‎
Alexander, ‎who made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Bauchi on Monday, said women were under-represented in decision making, resulting in their having limited ability to exercise legislative, executive and administrative powers. “I urge government at all levels, as well as the party structures, to encourage women to be politically effective.
‎
“Involving women in decision making will give the women a sense of political belonging and knowledge of how to run an administration,’’ the CHAWA president said.
‎
According to Alexander, there are complex issues involved in tackling women’s political participation. She said the complex issues included under-representation of women in decision making and lack of sufficient policies addressing women’s issues. The president said that the issues also included lack of access to information and resources for women who wanted to partake in political decisions. She said other issues were lack of network and cooperation between women leaders, as well as avenues for them to share knowledge, concerns, ideas, strategies and positions. According to Alexander, there should be consistent ways of addressing these issues of women’s political participation.

“I urge political parties and stakeholders to assist women leaders to start network meetings, discuss common problems and ascertain their vision for future development of the country,’’ she said. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
