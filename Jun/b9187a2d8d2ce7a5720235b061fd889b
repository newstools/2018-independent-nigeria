Italy’s new government, with Giuseppe Conte as prime minister, was sworn in Friday bringing to an end three months of political deadlock that began with an inconclusive election on March 4. The ceremony brought long sought-after stability to the country following months of political drama that had worried financial markets and Italy’s EU partners.
Just days ago fresh elections had seemed inevitable but on Thursday, President Sergio Mattarella named political novice Conte as prime minister for the second time in less than a fortnight and approved his revised government forged by the nationalist League and anti-establishment Five Star Movement. The new coalition plans to reject austerity and to increase spending, and it also wants to renegotiate EU treaties and review the bloc’s economic governance.
Its ambitious economic proposals – which include a monthly basic income for Italy’s poorest and a two-tier “flat” tax – have worried Brussels and financial markets given Italy’s massive €2.3 trillion ($2.7 trillion) debt. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
