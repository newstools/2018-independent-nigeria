I am one of the biggest fans of Linda Ikeji. I am one of the first bloggers in Nigeria and I dumped it after a while, as I did not see a future in it. How wrong I was. I am proud that someone like Linda Ikeji can stick to blogging and end up being a big success. I however have not been too impressed by some of her spin-off projects. Not that they are not good ideas but the administration is off. Her new Linda Ikeji TV, for one, is a great idea. She has been able to create great contents for the platform, but I do not get the medium with which she is distributing them. The online platform I believe is not a way to go. No platform survives with just their original contents. Itâ€™s either she takes her contents to other platforms or she includes other contents on hers. Netflix for example creates tons of contents; yet, their programmes are less that 10 per cent of what they offer on their platform. If people are to pay, they want to pay for variety. This brings me to the issue of the amount she charges. It starts from N2,000, for less than 30 shows. Some Cable TVs have 10 times more shows than that for N1,600. Even Netflix, with their hundreds of thousands of programmes, charge N3,600. I think she needs to re-evaluate her revenue stream. People will still need to pay for Internet. If she asks me, I believe she is the advert queen; she can put the shows up for free and get money through ads, till such a time that she has enough contents. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
