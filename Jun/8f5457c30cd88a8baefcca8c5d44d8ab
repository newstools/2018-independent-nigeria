Lagos – Benfica of Portugal new signing, Tyronne Ebuehi has promised to give his best for the country when the 2018 FIFA World Cup begins in Russia. Ebuehi was among the final 23-man list picked by coach Gernot Rohr for the Mundial in which the Super Eagles of Nigeria will slug it out at the group stage alongside Croatia, Iceland and Argentina. “Am happy that I did my best against the Three Lions of England on Saturday and I want to state that am ready to give my best at the World Cup,” he said. He, however, admitted that the Eagles had a difficult first half in their 2-1 loss to England at Wembley Stadium, but says they all gave the game a better thrust after half time. The Dutch-born defender, who got his sixth appearance for the Eagles in replacing Shehu Abdullahi at half time, said: ”I think we had it hard in the first half but I think in the second half we did very, very well. “Personally I just did what I can and it went well personally. There was also some small mistakes but I did a good job. To be honest for me it doesn’t matter. I like both of the roles. “(It) was a great atmosphere, great stadium also, of course it helps us a lot because the World Cup is the biggest stage and everybody is watching. A lot of people watched the game. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
