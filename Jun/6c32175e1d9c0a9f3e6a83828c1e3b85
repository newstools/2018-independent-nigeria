The polity since APC took up the reins of power has continued to heat up, and as 2019 draws closer, the heat is becoming scorching. At the moment, there are talks of impeachment of the president in the air and nobody knows if legislators will follow up on the threat. We all know that there is friction between the presidency and the Senate, and there have been allegations of witch-hunting and harassment on some members of the Senate – the senate president and Dino Melaye to be precise. Just this week, the police asked the Saraki to appear at the station over allegations of funding criminals. This quickly led to a joint session of legislators, and before you know it, the ‘I’ word started flying around. What will an impeachment mean at this point in time especially when there is a general election next year? I think the Senate should just ride this out and allow the people decide if the president should stay or leave next year. Who knows, even they may not be voted back to the House next year. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
