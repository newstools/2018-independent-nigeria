Yenagoa – Seriake Dickson, the Governor of Bayelsa State, has bemoaned what he described as lack of federal projects in the state, saying the situation is unacceptable. Particularly, Dickson said the Federal Government’s refusal to complete the $22billion Brass Liquefied Natural Gas (BLNG) and refinery projects was a strategy to weaken the economy of the state. The governor, who was speaking at a meeting he held with stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Yenagoa, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently address the bottlenecks militating against the commencement of work on the BLNG and refinery projects in Brass Local Government Area of the state. Dickson’s call came barely two weeks after the House of Representatives resolved at plenary to set up an ad-hoc committee to probe the implementation of the $22 billion Brass LNG project alleged to have been poorly managed. He said that starting work on the two economic projects and their eventual coming on stream would give the Ijaw people a sense of belonging and expand the revenue base of Nigeria in general. Dickson said the Ijaw ethnic nationality was very backward in development despite its immense contribution to the economic well being of the country. The governor urged the Federal Government and multinational corporations to partner the state government in tackling infrastructural deficit in the area. He told the PDP stakeholders that his administration had been labouring so hard with lean resources to single-handedly fund development projects such as construction of major roads and bridges, schools and health institutions across Bayelsa. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
