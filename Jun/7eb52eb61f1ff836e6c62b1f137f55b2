Lagos – Prof. Itse Sagay (SAN), Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), said on Sunday that the claim by former President Olusegun Obasanjo that President Muhammadu Buhari was plotting to frame him up and jail him was a frivolous allegation which nobody should take seriously. Sagay said the only threat to Obasanjo’s life was his mouth, a lack of respect for his successors, and his ego which makes him think he was still the president of Nigeria over 10 years after leaving office. Obasanjo, at the weekend, had raised the alarm that the Buhari-led administration had put his name on its security watch list, and that security agencies were plotting to arrest and put him in detention. But speaking in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT, Sagay, who had earlier said the heavens would not fall if Obasanjo was prosecuted over the $16 billion power project, said the former president should stop behaving like someone looking for sympathy from Nigerians. “I am surprised because his allegations are so frivolous. A former president and a retired General should be more serious than that. “He shouldn’t say things that nobody will take seriously. And he should stop behaving like somebody looking for attention and sympathy when nothing is threatening him. “The only threat he has is his mouth, his lack of appreciation of others and his ego which makes him think that he is Nigeria’s president for life and other persons are under him, so he has to control them for life. “So, there is no basis for his fear at all. Nobody is threatening him,” Sagay said. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
