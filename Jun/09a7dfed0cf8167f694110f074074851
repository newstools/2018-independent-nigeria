At least 35 migrants died after their boat capsized off the southern coast of Tunisia, the Tunisian government says. Sixty-seven others from Tunisia and elsewhere were also rescued by the coastguard as the country has become an important new route for migrants trying to make the crossing to Europe in the past year. This comes after moves against human traffickers in Libya, who have regularly enslaved, tortured or murdered migrants. The latest boat to go down off Tunisia was packed with about 180 people, most of whom were Tunisians, the country’s interior ministry said. “The boat was five miles from the Kerkennah Islands and 16 nautical miles from the city of Sfax,” the ministry said in a statement. Unemployed Tunisians and other Africans often seek to cross the Mediterranean sea in makeshift boats from Tunisia to Sicily in Italy. The deaths come on the same day Italy’s new Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said on a visit to Sicily that the island must stop being “the refugee camp of Europe”. Nine migrants, including six children, drowned in a similar accident off the coast of Turkey’s Antalya province Meanwhile, the Turkish coastguard said nine migrants, including six children, drowned in a similar accident off the coast of Antalya province. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
