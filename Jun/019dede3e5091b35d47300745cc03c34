Vladimir Ivanovsky, the head of Russia’s Military Police Directorate, arrived in Israel late Friday to discuss developments in Syria with Israeli officials. While in Israel, Ivanovsky — who is responsible for Russian forces deployed in Syria’s southern de-escalation zones — will meet with several Israeli military officials, the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation reported. According to the broadcaster, talks are expected to raise the issue of a sought-for withdrawal of Iranian forces from Syria’s strategic Golan region. On Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced that the PM had spoken by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a statement, Netanyahu’s office said the two leaders had discussed “regional developments and the situation in Syria, along with ongoing military coordination between the two countries [i.e., Russia and Israel]”. Israel has repeatedly said it would not allow Iran to maintain a long-term military presence in Syria.  comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
