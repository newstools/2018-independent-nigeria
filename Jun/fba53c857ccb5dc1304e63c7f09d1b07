The Federal High Court sitting in Kaduna on Thursday ordered the remand in prison custody of former Kaduna State governor, Ramalan Yero and three others arraigned before the court over money laundering charges. Yero was arraigned alongside a former minister, Nuhu Wya, ex-PDP chairman in the state, Abubakar Gaya-Haruna and former secretary to the state government, Hamza Ishaq. They were arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on a 4-count charge bordering on money laundering. The defendants had pleaded not guilty to the charges, and their counsel Yunus Ustaz (SAN) made an oral application for their bail, assuring the court that they would not jump bail. The prosecution counsel, Joshua Saidi, however, urged the court to remand the defendants pending proper filing of a written bail application. The Judge, Justice Mohammed Shuaâ€™ibu, after listening to the submissions of the counsel, denied the oral bail application and ordered that the defendants be remanded in prison till June 6. He directed the defence team to file a formal bail application for hearing on the next adjourned date. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
