The United States is warning Russia and Syria’s President Bashar Assad of “serious repercussions” for violations of an unraveling ceasefire in southwest Syria. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert says the U.S. remains “deeply troubled” by reports of “increasing Syrian regime operations” within the boundaries of the truce. She says U.S. reports show that Assad’s forces and militias have violated the cease-fire with airstrikes, rocket attacks and artillery. Nauert says the U.S. demands that Russia “restrain” Assad’s forces from further action in the zone covered by the truce. She says Secretary of State Mike Pompeo relayed that message to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov by phone over the weekend.The U.S. says it expects “all parties to respect the cease-fire.”  0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
