Lagos – The weak performance of the domestic bourse was sustained all through May as investors continued to sell off on market bellwethers. The All Share Index (ASI) fell 7.7 per cent in May, representing the largest monthly loss since January 2016. This performance is largely in line with the trend across emerging market equity indices as foreign investors continue to exit these markets. Two weeks ago, the All Share Index fell below the 40, 000.00 points mark for first time since January and during the week, fell to a 6-month low of 36,816.29 points. Accordingly, the index declined for the sixth consecutive week, falling 6.4 per cent week-on-week while year-to-date performance turned negative, settling at  -3.7  per cent. Similarly, market capitalization fell by N908.2 billion to N13.3 trillion. A total turnover of 2.699 billion shares worth N84.775 billion in 19,715 deals was traded last week by investors on the floor of the Exchange in contrast to a total of 1.372 billion shares valued at N16.022 billion that exchanged hands in the previous week in 21,099 deals. Activity level strengthened last week, albeit largely characterized by selling activity as average volume and value traded grew 42.1 per cent and 82.9 per cent to 389.3 million units and N5.9 billion respectively. The bearish run in the equities market extended into the 11th consecutive trading session last week, the longest losing streak since July 2015, as the All Share Index declined on all trading days in the week. Accordingly, the benchmark index slid 1.0 per cent on Monday, 0.7 per cent on Tuesday, 1.1 per cent on Wednesday, 1.3 per cent on Thursday and eventually closed Friday, down 3.4 per cent. During the week, the major drag to performance were losses in market bellwethers – Dangote Cement (-8.6%), Nestle Nigeria (-10.6%), Nigerian Breweries (-10.7%), Guaranty Trust Bank (-7.9%) and Zenith Bank (-4.3%). Trading in the top three equities namely- Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc, Access Bank Plc and Zenith Bank International Plc (measured by volume) accounted for 1.626 billion shares worth N70.285 billion in 2,882 deals, contributing 60.23 per cent and 82.91 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively. Despite the losses sustained in the week, investor sentiment strengthened, albeit still negative as market breadth improved to 0.5x from 0.3x in the prior week on account of 15 stocks that advanced relative to 28 that declined. The best performing stocks for the week were Eterna Oil (+20.1%), Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (+16.5%) and Mutual Benefits Assurance (+8.6%) while Internal Breweries (-22.4%), Lafarge Africa (-16.0%) and Forte Oil (-13.6%) were the worst performers in the week. Reacting, analysts at Afrinvest said “as sentiment on emerging market equities remains weak globally we believe market performance will remain pressured. On the flipside, technical analysis shows that the market is ripe for an upturn in performance given the current 14-day Relative Strength Index which is at 10.8 points (oversold region)”. 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
