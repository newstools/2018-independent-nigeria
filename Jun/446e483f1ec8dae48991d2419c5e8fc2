The 2016 Rio Olympics 5,000m silver medalist was in action last week in the Kenya Defense Forces Championships where she clocked 14:48.5 to cruise to victory and she is now eagerly counting down to Asaba 2018 and thereafter, the Intercontinental Cup. “For me, the Africa Championship is a good opportunity. I have never won the 5,000 meters at continental level and that is why I am relishing to compete in both events,” Obiri told reporters in Kenya after her latest victory at the Moi, Kasarani Stadium. Obiri believes she has recovered from her exhaustion following back-to-back competition at the global level and will be firing from all cylinders at the Africa Championships. “I am happy to run 14:35 at the Prefontaine Classic (Eugene USA) after a few weeks of experiencing under strength. This is due to low iron levels in my body. But I promise to get better from here.” She assured. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
