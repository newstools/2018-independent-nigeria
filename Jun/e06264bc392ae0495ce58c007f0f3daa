Four people died on the spot and scores of others suffered multiple injuries on Friday evening in an accident involving a school bus on the Kikima-Machakos road. Mbooni OCPD Mathew Gwio said the accident occurred at Kwa-Solo, the same spot where nine people died last year. He said the accident occurred when the bus belonging to Young Achievers School from Utawala in Nairobi was on it’s way back from Kitundu in Mbooni West Sub-county. The bus had been hired to ferry mourners from Nairobi. “The driver who appears to be new on the road lost control of the bus and landed in a gully killing four people on the spot,” Gwio told The Star on phone. The injured were rushed to Mbooni Sub-county hospital for treatment while bodies of the dead were moved to the facility’s mortuary. Nine people died at the same scene of accident last year. They were traveling in a 14-seater matatu that had 22 passengers on board at the time of the accident. Seven people also died at the same spot during the construction of the road. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
