Lagos – Super Falcons coach, Thomas Dennerby has expressed happiness over the victory of the team against their Gambian counterparts in the African Nations Cup qualifier. He said getting an away win puts his side in a suitable and comfortable situation ahead of the second leg on Mondayat Agege Stadium, Lagos, but also promised that they will not rest on their oars. The match saw Dennerby earn his first win with the reigning African champions, as Amarachi Okonkwo, who plays for Nasarawa Amazons, scored the lone goal in the 19th minute of proceedings at Baku Independence Stadium, The Gambia. However, the team frittered away many begging chances in the match, as Asisat Oshoala , Desire Oparanozie and Francesca Ordega’s attempts to increase the goal haul yielded no further results. The Falcons have won eight of the 10 editions of the African Cup and have represented the continent at all editions of the FIFA Women’s World Cup since the first competition was held in China 27 years ago. Dennerby’s first outing with the Nigerian girls was the international friendly with France senior Women team that saw Falcons battered 8-0 at MMArena in Le Mans on April 6, 2018. He has now set his sight on the return leg on Monday in Lagos, with the winner making it to the final tournament of the Total Africa Women’s Cup of Nations in Ghana. “When you start away, it is always good to come back home with clean sheet and win the game. If we can do that in an away game, we will have advantage to handle the game at home,” Dennerby reasoned. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
