Lagos – Croatia’s coach, Zlatko Dalic is seeking the support of United Arab Emirates (UAE) against Nigeria in their Group D opener of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that in what could be termed a search for spiritual aid at his former base in the Middle East, the former coach of Al Ain is hoping that UAE fans will turn their support to his country and help motivate Croatia to success in Russia. The 51-year-old tactician was in charge of Al Ain from March 2014 to January 2017 and led the side to an Arabian Gulf League (AGL) title and two cup wins, also reaching the final of the Asian Champions League in 2016 before defeat to South Korea’s Jeonbuk Motors. Dalic is guiding his native national team into their fifth World Cup appearance, where they will hope to better a record-best third-place finish, which was achieved in their first appearance back in 1998. Since then, in 2002, 2006 and 2014, they have failed to get out of the group. The UAE failed to qualify for the tournament, but Dalic is hoping fans from the Arab nation can follow him and lend support to his side as well. Dalic acknowledged: “We are playing Argentine, Nigeria and Iceland in our group and it’s not easy. Argentina are a candidate for the title. Nigeria and Iceland also won’t be easy rivals “I expect to find a lot of support from the UAE public. Most fans there are interested in Real Madrid and Barcelona, but there are few who encourage other teams.” comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
