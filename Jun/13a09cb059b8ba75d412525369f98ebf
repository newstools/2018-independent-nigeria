U.S. Ambassador, Dennis Shea, told the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on Friday that slow rulings could be vetoed if they take longer than the allowed 90 days. Shea added that this could throw down a new challenge to the WTO system of enforcing global trade rules. The WTO rules traditionally rely on “negative consensus’’ whereby a ruling can only be blocked if every member opposes it. “The consequence of the Appellate Body, choosing to breach (WTO dispute) rules and issue a report after the 90-day deadline, would be that this report no longer qualifies as an Appellate Body report for purposes of the exceptional negative consensus adoption procedure,’’ Shea said. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
