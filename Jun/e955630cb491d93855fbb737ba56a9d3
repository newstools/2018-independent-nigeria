International nuclear inspectors stand ready to go to North Korea, UN nuclear chief Yukiya Amano said after Pyongyang’s leader Kim Jong Un committed to denuclearisation in a joint statement with U.S. President Donald Trump. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Amano said he welcomed the statement and added that “the IAEA will closely follow the negotiations to be held between the two countries to implement the outcomes of the US-[North Korea] Summit.” The IAEA is prepared to carry out any inspections that may be requested by the concerned countries, Amano said in Vienna. Trump told reporters after the summit in Singapore that the nuclear disarmament process would be monitored by U.S. and international inspectors, without providing details. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
