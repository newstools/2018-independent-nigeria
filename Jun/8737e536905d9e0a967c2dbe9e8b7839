LAGOS – Super Eagles technical adviser, Gernot Rohr has opted to use alternative tactics for each of Nigeria’s group opponents as the 2018 FIFA World Cup kicks off in Russia on Thursday. Nigeria is in Group D alongside former champions, Argentina, Croatia and Iceland with the team’s first group match against Croatia on Saturday, June 16 follow by Iceland on Friday, June 22 and the last group’s match against Argentina on Tuesday, June 26. Consequently, Rohr refuted reports that he has opted to adopt a 3-5- 2 formation throughout the team’s matches at the World Cup. Though 3-5-2 appeared to be the effective formation for the Eagles in the second halves of their defeats by England and Czech Republic, Rohr said at the weekend that he will not make any tactical approach cast in stone. He stressed that the Eagles’ formation for each match at the 2018 World Cup will be determined by how the opponents line up. The German has tested out the 3-5-2, 4-1-2-1-2 and 4-2-3-1 formations in recent friendlies and training sessions. The Eagles will be seeking their first win in their opening game of the World Cup in 20 years when they clash with Croatia next Saturday, ahead of which Rohr said all the players have to up their game. ”Our style of play also depends on the opponent. We beat Argentina 4-2 in a friendly in November. It is not just about the results, but also about the appearance of the team. ”We want to give a good picture of the African continent – together with Senegal we are the only black African team in the tournament. ”Our offensive is well-known, that’s right. But I think we are already balanced,” the former Niger Republic, Gabon and Burkina Faso handler submitted. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
