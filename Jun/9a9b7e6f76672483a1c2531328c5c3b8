Lagos – Speaking in a recent interview on the three years of the Muhammadu Buhari administration, Prince Tony Momoh, a former Minister of Information and Pro-Chancellor and Chairman, Governing Council of the University of Jos (UNIJOS) said despite visible achievements, it is surprising how some Nigerians especially from the opposition will not see some of the major gains recorded by the government in the last three years except flaws. Momoh, who described the Buhari administration as the best in the country since 1999 said “A lot has been done by the Buhari administration in the last three years. It is not all negative as some people are portraying the situation.  I watched a television programme this morning where people are referring to negative things and are not even kind enough to refer to any positive thing. They were saying the president has done nothing in the last three years.  There is nobody who can say Buhari has done nothing” he said. Momoh’ s position was corroborated by Prof. Itse Sagay (SAN), Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) who said though three years is  not enough to assess the performance of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said achieved a lot within the period. He also faulted the claims of many who said the anti-corruption war has lost its steam in recent times. According to him, “It amazes me that Nigerians pretend that they are not aware of these things. If you ask them , what has Buhari achieved in the fight against corruption?. The response you will get is ‘he has achieved very little in the area of corruption’. In fact, that is a blatant lie. He has achieved a tremendous lot”. Speaking further he said “ I don’t think three years are enough to assess his performance but I think in these three years, sufficient achievements have been recorded by this government by which it can be judged. Three years won’t be a complete picture but there is substantial evidence for one to make an assessment”. Economy Based on the 3rd Year Report/Factsheet for May 2018 released by the administration, the government said economic growth is back and consolidating after the recession that occurred between 2016 and 2017, adding that the economy recorded 1.95 percent growth in Q1 2018. It also added that the administration’s priority sectors of Agriculture and Solid Minerals maintained consistent growth throughout the recession. Inflation has fallen for the 15th consecutive month,from 18.7 percent in January 2017 to 12.5 percent as of April 2018 while External Reserves of US$47.5 billion are the highest in 5 years, and double the size as of October 2016. Also, total exports in 2017 were 59.47% higher than for 2016. In 2017, agriculture exports grew 180.7% above the value in 2016. In 2017, raw material exports grew 154.2% above the value in 2016. Also In 2017, solid minerals exports grew 565% above the value in 2016. In 2017, exports of manufactured goods grew 26.8% above the value in 2016.  The first quarter of 2018 saw the fourth consecutive quarterly increase in capital importation since Q2 2017. The total value of capital imported in the quarter stood at US$6.3 billion. Nigeria’s Stock Market ended 2017 as one of the best- performing in the world, with returns in excess of 40 percent while 5 million new taxpayers have been added to the Tax Base since 2016, as part of efforts to diversify Government revenues. Tax Revenue increased to N1.17 Trillion in Q1 2018, a 51% increase on the Q1 2017 figure. N2.7 Trillion spent on Infrastructure in 2016 and 2017 fiscal years, an unprecedented allocation in Nigeria’s recent history. 14 moribund Blending Plants have been revitalised so far under the Presidential Fertilizer Initiative (PFI); with a total capacity of 2.3 million MT of NPK fertilizer. Also, the contribution of Solid Minerals’ to the Federation Account rose five-fold from N700 million in 2015 to N3.5 billion in 2017. The Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), the Federal  Government’s medium-term Economic Plan, was launched by President Buhari in April 2017. It charts a course for the Nigerian economy over the next four years (2017–2020). The Vision of the ERGP is to restore economic growth, invest in Nigerians, and to build a globally competitive economy, and the Plan aims to achieve these by focusing on five execution priorities: Stabilising the macroeconomic environment; Achieving Agriculture and Food Security; Ensuring energy efficiency (especially in power and petroleum products); Improving transportation infrastructure; and Driving industrialization, primarily through SMEs. To fast-track the implementation of the ERGP, the Federal Government launched the ERGP Focus Labs, as a targeted 6- week intervention (March to April 2018) bringing together all stakeholders to identify bureaucratic bottlenecks impacting medium-scale and large-scale investment projects in Nigeria, and then generate ideas and resources to resolve them. The just-concluded Phase 1 of the ERGP Focus Labs identified private-sector projects worth about US$22.5 billion – and with a potential for 500,000 jobs (in Agriculture, Transportation, Manufacturing and Processing, Power and Gas) – for unlocking by 2020. Giving his assessment on the economy in the last three years, Sagay said “On the economy, I think this government has done excellently well based on where we are coming from.  We were in a hole, deep in the ground. First, the government has dug us out and now it is raising us up above that level”. Infrastructure: The Buhari Administration has demonstrated a single- minded commitment to upgrading and developing Nigeria’s Transport, Power and Health Infrastructure.  In May 2018, the Federal Government launched the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF), under the management of the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority. The PIDF is kicking off with seed funding of of US$1.3 billion. Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) in March 2018 invested US$10m to establish a world-class Cancer Treatment Centre at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), and US$5m each in the Aminu Kano University Teaching Hospital and the Federal Medical Centres Umuahia, to establish modern Diagnostic Centres. These Centres should be completed before the end of 2018. In 2014, the Federal Government spent these sums on the following sectors: Transport (N14 billion), Agriculture and Water (N34 billion), Power, Works & Housing (N106 billion). In 2017 those figures jumped to: Transport (N127 billion), Agriculture & Water (N130 billion), Power, Works & Housing (N325 billion). Road projects are ongoing across every State of the country; many of these projects had been abandoned in recent years because of mounting debts owed by the Federal Government to contractors. The Buhari administration issued a N100 billion Sukuk Bond in 2017, Nigeria’s first sovereign Sukuk Bond. Proceeds from that Bond are funding 25 major road projects across ;the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Power Sector More than 2,000MW of additional power generation capacity by the end of 2018 – some of it via publicly owned plants (Afam Fast Power, 240MW); others through private sector investment supported by the Federal Government.
