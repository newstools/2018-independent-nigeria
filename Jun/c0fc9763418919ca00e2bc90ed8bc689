Lagos – Coach Gernot Rohr, Super Eagles coach, has revealed that all the 23 players in camp are fit for their opening World Cup game against Croatia on Saturday, June 16. Rohr, who spoke on a video the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) posted on its twitter handle minutes after they touched down in Russia where they will further intensify preparations for the must-not-lose match against Croatia on Saturday, said that there were no no injury worries. He noted that the most important victory they achieved in the course of their preparations was that all the players came out fitter with no worries of any kind. “We had a nine-day hard work in Austria; every day, we had two training sections on a wonderful grass but with mixed conditions. We did a lot of works especially after the game against Czech Republic. Everybody is fit and there is no injury, which is the most important thing and the players responded very well. “In fact I can tell you that everybody is much better now than before and it was a good preparation. We are very fit for our opening match and subsequent matches,” he told the NFF twitter handle. Argentina will face Iceland by 2pm Nigeria time, while the Super Eagles will file out by 7pm for the much awaited tie against Croatia. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
