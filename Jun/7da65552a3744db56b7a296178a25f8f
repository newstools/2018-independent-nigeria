ASABA – A fresh crisis is brewing between two Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) aspirants to the Delta State House of Assembly in Ughelli South While Olorogun Taleb Tebite, a former member of the Assembly, has declared his intention to return to the state legislature in 2019, saying his decision to re-contest was driven by the need to allow experience drive development in the constituency. However, another aspirant, Wilson Oghenemu, claimed that since 1999 till date, no one from Jeremi ward 4 or Ovwahwa son/daughter has tasted any elective positions both in the local government or at the state levels. Tebite, who spoke during the flag off and inauguration of his campaign at Okpare -Olomu, said his membership of the Assembly impacted positively on the lives of his people, stressing that his return to the house would afford him the opportunity to consolidate on the achievements. He said he was yielding to pressure from his people to run for the Assembly because of the love he has for his people, stressing that his biggest motivation was to ensure delivery of democracy dividends through effective representation. Tebite said he would always consult with leaders and stakeholders from time to time in carrying out his legislative duties. But Chief E.D Obofukoro, a PDP chieftain and elder in Jeremi Ward 4, expressed his displeasure over Tebite interest and formal declaration to run for the 2019 Delta Assembly election in Ughelli South. He called on those, who alleged are trying to sabotage the zoning arrangement to desist from such, saying they they are only doing so because selfishness, greed and wickedness. While praying for Oghememu, who visited him at Jeremi to notify and declare his intent to vie for the Assembly seat in the 2019 general election lamented the insincerity of other axis in the local government, Obofukoro said despite the zoning agreement reached over the years, those who have benefitted from the arrangement are still jostling for the 2019 slot which is clearly known to all that it is the turn of Jeremi Ward comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
