Lagos – Dropped Super Eagles goalkeeper to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Dele Ajiboye, has said that he nurse no grudge against anybody in the aftermath of his being dropped from the World Cup team. In a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT in Lagos on Tuesday, Ajiboye said that he believes his time will come. “I think it is not yet my time. My time, I believe will come at appropriate time when God said it is time for me. “I nurse no grudge against anybody for being dropped. I was not the only one and I know it is not the end of the career,” he said. The Plateau United goaltender however wished the team well at the World Cup and said they will scale the group stage. “We have a good team and I see them scaling through the group stage. Our only obstacle will be Argentina but then, we will qualify for the second round. “The major factor that will work for the team is the unity among the players and officials. “United we stand, divided we fall. There is unity in the team and this will go a long way to help the team in Russia”, he said. It will be recalled that Ajiboye, Simeon Moses, Mikel Agu, Junior Lokosa, Ola Aina, Uche Agbo and Stephen Eze were dropped from the 30-man provisional list for the World Cup by coach Gernot Rohr. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
