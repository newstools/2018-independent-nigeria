Brazil head coach Tite has admitted that Neymar is “not 100 percent fit” ahead of the Selecao’s World Cup opener against Switzerland in Rostov on Sunday. The Paris Saint-Germain forward has been out of action since February with a broken metatarsal in his right foot, missing the final few months of the domestic season and only returning for Brazil in two friendlies against Croatia and Austria. Neymar will almost certainly still start the game, but it remains to be seen whether he will be able to finish, or at what sort of level he will be able to play. Tite, though, was optimistic that his star man would have an impact on the game, despite his preparation. “Neymar is not 100 percent yet,” Tite said. “But he is privileged and strong physically — he is very quick, and he hasn’t lost that. I hope he’ll be ready, but the medical staff knows better. He’s good enough to play very well.” Tite confirmed that his whole squad was fit to play, other than new Manchester United midfielder Fred, who is still recovering from an ankle injury. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
