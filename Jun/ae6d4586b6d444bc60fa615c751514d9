Nigeria will today attempt to rekindle their World Cup run with a very decisive match against Iceland at the Volgograd Arena. The last time Nigeria played Iceland was in 1981 during a friendly affair and the match ended 3-0 in favour of the Europeans. In their opening group match, Nigeria offered very little resistance as Croatia dominated and were deservedly gifted two opportunities through set pieces, which resulted to goals. There is no doubt that the Super Eagles have talented players and there was a certain expectation that Nigeria could perhaps surprise in Group D. For today’s match, winning is not an option for the Super Eagles if they hope of making it past the group stage even as their last match against Argentina will certainly not be an easy ride. For Iceland, their surprise 1-1 score line against one of the tournament’s favourites, Argentina, will give them a huge confidence. Iceland may not boast of any particularly outstanding player but their good display, anchored on cohesiveness and compactness, has been their strength. Well organised at the back and dangerous when going forward, Iceland managed to win the point against Argentina despite having only 23 percent ball-possession throughout the match. Also, Nigeria must demonstrate a good attacking threat if they hope to overcome the debutants after Iceland showed their defensive discipline in that Argentina draw. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
