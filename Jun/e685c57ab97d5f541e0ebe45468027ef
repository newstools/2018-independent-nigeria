ASABA – Hon. Peter Asupa Forteta, Commissioner for Urban Renewal in Delta State, has disclosed that the Ministry always resorts to Memorandum of Understanding with leaders of any community where it wants to carry out development projects. Forteta who revealed this Monday in Asaba during a ministerial press briefing declared that projects embarked on by the ministry to help create urban development in rural areas were picked by the people of the communities. ‘’Choice of projects was specifically demanded by traditional rulers, after then, the ministry will start work’,” he said The commissioner, who regretted that though the rain had been disturbing work on projects, encouraged that the lifespan of such projects would be fast-tracked to be completed within two months as no project would be abandoned. ‘’With road construction projects ongoing in Burutu, Okpe, Isoko South Local Governments, construction of projects is also ongoing in several parts of the state to turn rural communities to urban cities for the continuous development of the state,’’ Asupa posited. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
