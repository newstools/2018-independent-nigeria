Some members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo on Saturday defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The defectors were received by Chief Dan Orbih, the state’s PDP chairman, at a rally in Fugar, Etsako Central Local Government Area. Some of the defectors said they left the APC because of the absence of internal democracy. Captain Patrick Isede (rtd), a former Local Government Secretary and leader of the defectors, said they decided to join the PDP because the party symbolises peace. He also expressed optimism that the PDP would ameliorate the present hardship in the country if it emerged victorious in the 2019 general elections. Benjamin Enakpene, a former Executive Secretary of  Etsako Local Government Council, said he and his supporters left the APC because they could no longer endure the lack  of  internal democracy in the party. He alleged that the APC machinery in the area had remained under the control of two individuals. Okauso Felix, another defector and  former councillor,  said he dumped his former party because it lacked good leaders. He said he and his supporters had waited for nine years for a change, which was yet to come, adding that the PDP was more organised and democratic. Orbih said the defection was a signal of the party’s victory in the 2019 general elections, even as he expressed joy that the defectors were joining the party  due to their personal convictions. Orbih urged the people to ensure that they were registered, saying a vote for the party would be a vote for democracy. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
