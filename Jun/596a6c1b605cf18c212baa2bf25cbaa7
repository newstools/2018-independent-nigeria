Super Eagles in Group D will kick off their campaign against Croatia on June 16 before playing Iceland on June 22 and Argentina on June 26. Mourinho said this despite that Super Eagles lost their third successive preparatory game on Wednesday. The coach in his prediction in collaboration with YouTube channel RT tipped Nigeria to place second in the group and likely play France in the Round 16 games. Though, he did not predict the group winner, he, however, believes that Iceland will not reach the second round in their first attempt. Other predictions by the coach are that Spain will top group B with Portugal placing seconds. To him Russia will come out of group A as the second best team with Uruguay winning the group. He predicts that France will win group C with Australia winning the second ticket ahead of Peru and Denmark. He thinks England will win group G ahead of Poland with Belgium failing to go past the group stage. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
