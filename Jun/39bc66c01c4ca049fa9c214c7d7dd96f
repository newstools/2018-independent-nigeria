DJ Khaled has landed another major tour support slot after Beyonce and Jay-Z invited him to join them on their upcoming “On The Run II” U.S. tour. Just weeks after he wrapped up dates with Demi Lovato, the rapper has confirmed he’ll join Beyonce’s proteges Chloe x Halle for the dates, which will begin on July 25 in Cleveland, Ohio. Announcing the news on Twitter, Khaled posted the “On the Run II” promo flyer and wrote: “Hitting the road with @SC and @Beyonce in North America for the #OTR2 tour!!” Beyonce and Jay-Z will kick off the joint tour in Europe later this month. Support acts for the overseas dates have not yet been announced. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
