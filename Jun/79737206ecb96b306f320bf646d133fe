LAGOS – The Sanlam Group celebrates its 100th birthday, and we at FBNInsurance are proud of our association with this financial services giant, which first opened its doors in Cape Town, South Africa. Founded in 1918, Sanlam has a rich history, the Group has evolved over the years from a traditional life insurance company to a broad-based diversified financial services provider that specialises in insurance (life and general), financial planning, retirement, investments and wealth. In 1998 Sanlam demutualised, listing on the JSE Ltd and the Namibian Stock Exchange. The Group was restructured into several independent businesses within a federal business structure. Today, Sanlam is a diversified financial services provider with an extensive product offering catering for all market segments. It also remains a pioneer of technological development and innovation. The Group has consistently grown its local as well as an international footprint – it now has a presence in 33 African countries, India, Malaysia, Philippines, the UK /Ireland, the US, Switzerland, and Australia. From Cape to Casablanca, the Group is particularly proud of its footprint across Africa, boasting more than 11 800 employees throughout the continent. It has taken the Group 100 years of doing things properly and doing them for good to get this far. While its centenary year is a chance to reflect on years of product and technological innovation, looking after society and creating financial security for all, Sanlam is looking ahead towards the next 100 years – firmly committed to continue creating lasting value and enabling people to live their best lives possible for now and for generations to come. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
