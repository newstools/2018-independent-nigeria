LAGOS – Chris Maduka, a political scientist and National President of the New Tone In Leadership Foundation, has said that the declaration of June 12 as Democracy Day by President Muhammadu Buhari is proper. Maduka, who spoke to DAILY INDEPENDENT on Tuesday, also applauded the honour done to the late Chief Moshood Abiola, saying the late business mogul cum politician deserved it. He said: “MKO Abiola was a likable person and a man with a large heart. The declaration of June 12 is good and the honour done to Abiola was well deserved, not just because he stood for an election and won, but because of the struggle he put up for the defence of democracy and died for it. “June 12 is not just for Abiola alone. It is for all Nigerians. All of us are champions of June 12. June 12 means different things to different people, depending on who you are. It is a mixed basket.” Maduka, however, lamented that people misuse June 2 for political gains, which he stressed, should not be the case, adding that Babagaba Kingibe, Abiola’s running mate, does not deserve national honour over June 12. He stated: “But, I don’t think that Babagana Kingibe deserved to be honoured. He jumped ships, unlike Abiola who stood by June 12 and died for it. By declaring June 12 Democracy Day, a right thing was done.” Maduka, however, said that President Buhari played a smart game as he saw an opportunity and utilised it well, adding, “Those who say his action is deceitful may be right. Everybody is cashing in on a national tragedy. “There are also several other wrongs that need to be righted. Those who question the timing are not completely wrong. “President Buhari has been in power for three years. Why did he wait till now? He is not known to have openly condemned the cancellation of the June 12 election.” 1 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
