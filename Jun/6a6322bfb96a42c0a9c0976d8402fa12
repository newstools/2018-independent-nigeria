LAGOS The Minister of Youth and Sports, Barrister Solomon Dalung has pledged Federal government’s commitment to finance and support all athletes preparing for the African Youth Championship (AYC) in Algiers next month. Dalung made the pledge when he visited some of the athletes camped at Agura Hotel, Abuja at the weekend. He congratulated the youngsters for making the list of those invited to camp and promised that all their camp allowances will be given to them before they leave for the games. “I want to assure you that government will finance and support your camping. You will be given all your entitlements because under my watch, nobody’s right will be taken away. Your welfare is very important and we will deliver on that. As we do that, we expect you too to work very hard and make your country proud.” He also urged the athletes to train hard and make good use of the opportunity given to them. “The camping exercise will avail you the opportunity to prove yourself. I believe that at the end of the day, you should be able to challenge us by making it difficult for us to decamp anybody. You can only do this by competing favorably and making the final list. “As young athletes, I must tell you that in sports lies a great career. You cannot be a successful sportsman or woman without self-discipline, respect and determination. This is a golden opportunity and you must cash into it. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
