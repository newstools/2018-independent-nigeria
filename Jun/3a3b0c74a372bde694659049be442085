Dr. Innocent Chukwuma, Chairman of Innoson Motors, has reportedly said that there was no Supreme Court judgment against GTBank as earlier stated. Innoson had earlier deleted his declaration on social media that the apex court has ordered GTBank to pay him N14 billion within 14 days. This was followed by a statement by reportedly his spokesman, Cornelius Osigwe, in which Innoson walked back from his declaration stating instead that “There have been a lot of misinterpretations on the Press Release published by Innoson Group on the decision of the Supreme Court.” Thursday last week, Innoson caused a social and online media storm by claiming that the Supreme Court had ruled in his favour for GTBank to pay him N14 billion. However, records of the court proceedings showed no such ruling. GTBank had also advised the public that Innoson’s claims were “false, mischievous and malicious.” “There was no directive or order issued by the Supreme Court of Nigeria to the bank to make any payment to any of its debtor customer. We again reiterate that there is no iota of truth in the falsehood being peddled by desperate and mischievous elements and the public should disregard same in its entirety,” part of the bank’s press statement read. 2 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
