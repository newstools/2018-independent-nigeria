The 48th President and Chairman of Council of the Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria (CIIN), Mrs Funmi Babington-Ashaye, as part of her achievements in office has bequeathed a world class electronic-library to the Institute. The library, sitting on the third floor of the Institute’s head office on Lagos Street in Ebute-Meta, is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities, comparable to what can be found in the library of other insurance institutes abroad. Babington-Ashaye speaking during the unveiling of the e-library said: “The coming on board of the library was a fulfillment of her vision to provide a conducive study center in the secretariat, where members can come in to do research, and deepen their knowledge. “With experiences drawn from other professional institutes abroad including the CII UK, I feel accomplished that the Institute in Nigeria could boast of such a library of international standard. Babington-Ashaye said : “It is mine believe that our members we take advantage of this facility to enhance their knowledge and update their skills for the benefits of the entire insurance industry”. The CIIN under the watch of Babington-Ashaye recently completed the upgrade of the secretariat building, started about two years ago with the vision to provide the secretariat staff a decent and conducive environment to work. Babington-Ashaye in her acceptance speech on July 25, 2017 when she assumed the presidency of the CIIN with the theme ‘Insurance: Imperative for Education and Enlightenment’ said the choice was informed by the need to confront lack of general awareness which is the greatest challenge facing the profession and the Industry. “People lack knowledge about Insurance and it is importance in all human endeavours including business undertakings,” she added. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
