LAGOS – The National Association of Telecommunications Subscribers (NATCOMS) and Consumer Protection Council (CPC) have warned telecoms service providers in the country against hiking the tariff of telecoms services. They spoke against the backdrop of plans by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to begin the implementation of one of the provisions of Cybercrime Act 2015 which made provision for the collection of 00.05 per cent levy on all electronic transactions to be deposited into a National Cyber Security Fund account.

Babatunde Irukera, director-general, CPC, said “What consumer will accept is a fair and transparent reason that directly accepts the service they enjoyed. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
