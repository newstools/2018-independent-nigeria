Croatia put up a spectacular performance in their second Group D match as they defeated two-time champions, Argentina 3-0 at the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium to seal a spot in the last 16. Caballero’s clanger sets Croatia on the way to comfortable victory as Ante Rebic score the first goal in the 53rd minutes while Luka Modric made it two in the 80th minutes before Ivan Rakitic scored the third goal in the 90th minutes. The victory thus put the qualification of Argentina at a tight rope even if the Argentines win their last match against Nigeria on June 26. The Super Eagles of Nigeria will play Iceland in the group’s other match on Friday (today). 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
