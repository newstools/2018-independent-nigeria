Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron and Uzbek leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev over the phone, presidential source said. The source, who asked not to be named due to restrictions on talking to the media, said Erdogan and Macron discussed bilateral and regional issues as well as Syria, particularly Turkey-U.S.-agreed Manbij roadmap, counter-terrorism and the refugees. The leaders also emphasized the importance of cooperation regarding the regional issues, the sources added. The Manbij roadmap was first announced after a meeting in Washington last week between Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The deal focuses on the withdrawal of the PKK-affiliated YPG terror group from the northern Syrian city and stability in the region. Earlier, Turkish and Uzbek leaders spoke over the phone and reaffirmed their commitment to further developing relations between the two countries. Mirziyoyev also expressed his goodwill on the upcoming Turkish presidential elections on June 24. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
