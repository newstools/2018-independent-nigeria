Delta Ijaw Political Assembly (DIPA), inaugurated weekend in Asaba with Mr. J.T. Government as chairman, has passed vote confidence of on Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and vowed to massively return an Okowa/Otuaro ticket in 2019. Kingsley Otuaro, the deputy governor, named earlier as chair of the body’s Board of Trustees (BoT), with the support of Senator James Manager and others unveiled DIPA’s logo. Otuaro, who spoke in Ijaw language, stated: “I’m impressed by the massive turn-out for this inauguration. DIPA is a united front poised to advance the political interests of the Ijaw nation in Delta. I want to thank the Ijaw for their unique support in 2015. I am confident that the Ijaw who returned outstanding votes to the Okowa/Otuaro ticket in 2015 will, in their known sincerity, do same in 2019 as resolved here today.” Emmanuel Amgbaduba, who spoke earlier, had expressed hope that the Ijaw, resolving to work together, would cross the political Red Sea, just as Senator Manager charged them to always guard power by massively supporting their own such as the Okowa-Otuaro ticket. Giving his inaugural speech, the DIPA chair thanked the Ijaw political family for the trust and opportunity to lead, and assured that the Ijaw would work assiduously to return Okowa andOtuaro in 2019 and continue to promote “our political interest”. DIPA’s national officers include Bosin Ebikeme (vice chairman), Eric Omare (secretary), Smart Asekutu as (treasurer), Mrs. Tina Yinkore (women leader) and Frank Omare (spokesman). Other members are P.C. Embelegha (chief whip), New-world Safugha (chief mobilisation officer), Godwin Edumogiren (financial secretary) and Jude Sinebe (youth leader), Joel Bisina (assistant secretary), Raymos Guanah (legal Officer) and Godbless Omoni. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
