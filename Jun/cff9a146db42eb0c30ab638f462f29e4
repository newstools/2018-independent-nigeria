GUSAU – Zamfara State Governor, Alhaji Abdulaziz Yari has lamented that the constant bloodbaths, terrorism, mayhems and other gory episodes being let loose in the state has appeared to defying all ability and reasons, saying that he no longer sees himself as being the chief security officer in the state. The governor made the remark during the Sallah broadcast to the citizens of the state in his Talata Mafara residence on Friday stressing that if some unavoidable conditionalities were not attached to his position as the state governor, he would have resigned as the chief security officer of the state. Governor Yari who is also the Chairman, Nigeria’s Governors Forum explained that it is no longer a secret that Zamfara State has become a notable colony of armed banditry in the country, noting that his government has committed a lot of resources to counter terror attacks but to no avail. According to him, the armed bandits are on daily basis letting gory episodes that continue to affect legitimate endeavour of the citizens, pointing out that real progress to the solution of the problem has not yet been achieved. The governor vowed that his administration would be ready to welcome any useful suggestion that could lead to the end of these problems, pointing out that nobody is perfect and that if he was given any concrete reason that his government was responsible for the bloodbaths and mayhems in the state he would be ready to make some adjustment. According to him, the problem cannot be solved if everybody continues to fix blames on the government or the security operatives, saying that no one is defeated until he started fixing blames on some one else, advising that all should be out to fix the problem as security is the responsibility of all not only of the security agencies. He maintained that the insecurity situation in the state has called for well coordinated security network and public attention so as to get the state out of this mess that has enveloped the state. 4 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
