Lagos – The Super Eagles ended their World Cup preparations with a defeat after they were pegged by the Czech Republic in their last tune-up match played at Rudolf-Tonn-Stadium, Rannersdorf, Austria on Wednesday. The match was even until Czech Republic scored in the 25th minute through Tomas Kalas. Francis Uzoho, in goal for Nigeria, did well the first time to keep out Soucek’s header before Tomas Kalas turned home the rebound to give Czechs a lead. The Czechs would have made it two in the 30th minute after Patrick Schick blazed over the bar when he outran Nigerian backline but found his short higher than the goal post. Two minutes later, Odion Ighalo found himself in Czech’s vital area but he was denied by Tomas Vaclick in goal for the Europeans. The first half ended with the margin but on resumption, Tyronne Ebuehi replaced Shehu Abdullahi even as rainstorm delayed the match for 10 minutes. In the 62nd minute, Victor Moses’ well-taking free kick met a resilient Czech Republic wall and the danger was averted. Meanwhile, the result meant that of the five friendly matches for the team after their qualification, they won one, drew one and lost three. Nigeria defeated Poland 1-0 in Wroclaw before losing 0-2 to Serbia in London. Thereafter, they drew 1-1 with DR of Congo in Port Harcourt and followed that up with a 1-2 loss to England, which was followed by the Czech Republic defeat. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
