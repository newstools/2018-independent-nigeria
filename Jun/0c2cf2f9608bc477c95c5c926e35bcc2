After many of their supporters have butted heads and risked their lives to fight for their ‘masters’, ex-Ogun State governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel and Senator Buruji Kashamu have settled their differences and they even seal their reconciliation with a hug. At a closed-door meeting, which took place during the week in Abuja, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, Senator Buruji Kashamu, and Senator Ben Bruce, who are chieftains and national leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), came together with the aim of resolving the issues that have rocked the Ogun State chapter of the party over the years. The meeting lasted over three hours, during which the two major figures in the face-off, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, and Kashamu, discussed all their issues and resolved them. They agreed to work together going forward in the interest of the party and the people of Ogun State. After their reconciliation, both men hugged while a delighted Ben Bruce clapped as he observed. 0 comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
