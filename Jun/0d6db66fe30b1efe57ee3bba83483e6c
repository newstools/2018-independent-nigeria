Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was shuttling between seven rallies across Istanbul on Friday, the second-to-last day of campaigning before high-stakes elections in which his political future is in doubt for the first time. In his first campaign speech in Kartal, a district on the Asian side of Istanbul along the Marmara Sea coast, the president touted his administration’s development schemes and vowed to open one of his pet projects there, a free tea and coffee house. Report says Turkey holds simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday, with polls showing they’re too close to call. “We have one day left, are we ready to go from door to door? “I trust in my people, I love my people. My people will give the opposition the necessary answer on Sunday,’’ Erdogan stressed, calling out especially to the women and youth. Erdogan touched down at Istanbul’s new airport on Thursday amid much fanfare, with Turkey’s pliant broadcasters dutifully switching coverage away from a major rally in Izmir by his main challenger Muharrem Ince. The yet-unnamed airport, Istanbul’s third, is set to open in 2023, and Erdogan said it would aim to become the world’s top facility with 105 million passengers. “Why shouldn’t it be named after Recep Tayip Erdogan?’’ Transportation Minister Ahmet Arslan told newsmen, adding that the president would decide the name. Istanbul’s main airport is named for Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern, secular Turkish republic. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
