The French and Italian leaders have agreed to work together to push for changes to the European Union’s migration rules after previously disagreeing on the issue. President Emmanuel Macron and Premier Giuseppe Conte said EU regulations requiring asylum-seekers to apply in the first country they enter and remain there while their cases are processed were not working. Mr Macron said the policy and others have left Italy, usually the first European country reached on the route across the Mediterranean from North Africa, without the support that is supposed to be a benefit of a united Europe. “The proper response is European, but the existing European response has not adapted,” said the French leader, seen as strongly pro-EU. Mr Conte, who heads the populist, anti-EU government that took over Italy on June 1, echoed “my friend Emmanuel”. “The concept itself of the ‘state of first entry’ must be rethought. He who puts his feet in Italy puts his feet in Europe,” said Mr Conte, who was a law professor before he became premier. They both called for steps to beef up Europe’s borders to prevent illegal immigration after meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris. comments Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?
