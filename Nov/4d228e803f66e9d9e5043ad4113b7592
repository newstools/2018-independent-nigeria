Lagos – The Cranes of Uganda on Tuesday held the Super Eagles of Nigeria to a goalless draw in an international friendly match played at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba. Still basking in the euphoria of their qualifications for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations following Matchday 5 games over the weekend, players of the two teams lived up to expectations. The match kicked off at 4.30pm with players of both teams played cautiously to avoid injuries ahead of the Nations Cup next year. The Super Eagles were better placed to secure a win in their maiden game after booking a spot to next year’s African Cup of Nations finals but Sebastien Desabre’s selfish defence held firm to continue their impressive run so far. Sporting Charleroi striker, Victor Osimhen, on his full debut, had the clearest chances for the hosts but his efforts were off target while debutant and former U17 teammate, Samuel Chukwueze impressed. While the Ugandans were happy and celebrated the draw result, the Nigerians are licking the wounds of their inability to avenge a 1-2 loss to the Cranes in a 2008 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier played in Kampala that would have been disastrous, had the Eagles not won the first encounter 1-0 in Abeokuta. The Nigerians also failed to avenge the 1-0 defeat suffered in the hands of the Ugandans in a friendly match in Uyo in March 2015. Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, who was the special guest, praised the Super Eagles for a good match and urged the leadership of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to put all hands on deck for the team’s successful outing at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations billed for Cameroon. Okowa also promised that the state is ready to host as many matches as possible of the national teams if approached by the NFF.
