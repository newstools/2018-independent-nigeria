A commuter train derailed outside the Spanish city of Barcelona on Tuesday, killing one person and leaving 44 injured, emergency services said on Twitter, according to Presstv.com reports. A landslide triggered the crash between the northeastern towns of Terrassa and Manresa just after 6 a.m. (0500 GMT), a spokeswoman for the train company Renfe said. The north of Spain has suffered heavy rains causing flooding and landslides in the last few days. The accident happened in the town of Vacarisses, about 35 kilometers northeast of Barcelona, when two of the train’s six carriages, carrying nearly 150 passengers, came off the tracks, local emergency services added on Twitter. Images shared by the regional fire department showed the train sitting skewed and at an angle off the train tracks. In 2013, 79 people were killed and about 140 injured when a train travelling from Madrid to northwest Spain came off the tracks. It was Spain’s worst train wreck for decades.
