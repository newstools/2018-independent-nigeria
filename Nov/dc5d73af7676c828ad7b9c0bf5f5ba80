ENUGU – Enugu’s top one-stop retail shop, Roban Stores, and a human rights lawyer, Olu Omotayo, are now before the Enugu State High Court over the violation of the rights of the legal practitioner’s wife. The lawyer, in suit No E/747/2018, is asking the court to among others, order Roban Stores to pay his wife, Mrs. Rita Omotayo, N10 million as damages for allegedly infringing on her fundamental human rights. Joined as 1st to 3rd respondents respectively are Rob Onyebuchi Anwatu (managing director), Lady Nwanne Anwatu (executive director) and Roban Stores. In the suit, the group prayed the court to declare that the act of the respondents in arresting the applicant (Mrs. Omotayo) in full public glare, subjecting her to a search and turning her handbag upside down at Roban Stores on the 30th day of August 2018, on the unreasonable suspicion of stealing items from the stores constituted a degrading treatment and a flagrant violation of the applicant’s fundamental rights and was, therefore, illegal. But, responding to the suit through its lawyer, H.B.C. Ogboko, submitted that there is no store known as Roban Stores owned by the 1st and 2nd respondents, adding that the subject matter of the litigation was a different legal entity distinct from the applicants. Ogboko described the suit as malicious, gold digging and an abuse of court process, adding that the suit was filed in bad faith. According to Ogboko, by the circumstances of the case, the fundamental rights of the applicant had not been violated or breached in any way. Ogboko insisted that the applicant was not entitled to any protection of the court nor any form of damages at all, describing the case as a calculated attempt by the applicant to smear the image and reputation of the 1st and 2nd respondents. He insisted that the applicant is only interested in using the court to commit fraud, adding that it is in the intest of justice that the application be refused.
