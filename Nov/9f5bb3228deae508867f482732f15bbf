The English Football Association (EFA) has sold more than 20,000 tickets for England’s friendly against the United States since former captain Wayne Rooney’s one-off international comeback was confirmed. This was revealed by an EFA spokeswoman on Tuesday. Rooney, England’s record scorer with 53 goals, is expected to be brought on as a substitute to claim his 120th cap in the charity game at Wembley on Thursday. Rooney’s involvement has led to a late rush for tickets over the past week, with an attendance of about 60,000 now predicted. “Looking forward to meeting up with the @England squad later today, always a huge honour. An exciting week for @FoundationWR,” Rooney wrote on Twitter before joining Gareth Southgate’s squad on Monday. Rooney, who began his career at Everton, spent 13 seasons at Manchester United. After a season back at Everton, he moved to the United States to join D.C. United, helping them to the MLS playoffs in his first campaign. Southgate is expected to give his first-choice players some rest against the United States ahead of a Nations League clash against Croatia on Sunday.
