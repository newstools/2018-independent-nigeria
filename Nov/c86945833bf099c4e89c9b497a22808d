British Transport Police on Monday said former England football star Paul Gascoigne was charged with “one count of sexual assault by touching.” The 51-year-old, known as “Gazza,” was arrested after a train journey in northeast England in August, but was later released pending a police investigation into the incident, according to DW. In a tweet that has since been deleted, Gascoigne recounted his version of events: “I heard [someone] call a girl in front of me a fat cow so I got upset [and] sat next [to] her and said don’t worry sweetheart you’re beautiful inside [and] out.” “I pecked her [and] said it’s ok I was called fat [years] ago,” he added. To give someone a “peck on the cheek” is British slang for a kiss on the cheek. He is due to appear in court on December 11.
