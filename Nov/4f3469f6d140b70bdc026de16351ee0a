Arsene Wenger believes Thierry Henry can succeed, if he is given time at Monaco, despite a poor start to his managerial career. The former Arsenal and France legend took over with Monaco in a 10-game winless streak across all competitions, that saw Leonardo Jardim lose his job. But Henry has not been able to muster any sort of turnaround, with the new boss winless in his first five games at the club. Monaco host reigning Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday, with PSG perfect in the league this season. But despite the poor start to his time at Monaco, Henry’s former manager at Arsenal, Wenger, believes the ex-striker has all the tools he needs to succeed if given the time. “He has the right understanding, he has the right knowledge,” Wenger told beIN SPORTS. “But, there’s always two aspects when you come in as a new manager. “The first impact is physiologically positive and then you can work. “So at the moment the bad luck for him is that the first impact has not worked so he will have to be given time. “That is the most important thing. He will get it right if he’s given time.” Monaco are mired in 19th place in Ligue 1, with their only win coming back in August against Nantes.
