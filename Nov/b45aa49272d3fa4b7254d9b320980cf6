XAVIER NDAH Lagos – Akparawa Gospel Etim, Chairman of All Akwa Ibom Indigenes in Lagos For Udom 2019 (AKIL4U), has warned those selling their permanent voters’ cards (PVCs) to desist from doing so, as it is tantamount to selling their future. Rising from a stakeholders’ meeting in support of Governor Udom Emmanuel’s 2019 election bid in Lagos at the weekend, Etim advised all attendees to send strong messages to their relatives back home to stop selling or giving out their PVCs to anybody. He advised them to keep them in order to exercise their civic responsibility by voting Governor Emmanuel to consolidate on the gains of democracy already being enjoyed in the state. To buttress his point, Etim pointed out the massive infrastructural developments, industrialisation, food sufficiency, education and quality healthcare delivery of Governor Emmanuel, which he said, must be sustained, maintained and completed in his second term. “The governor must be allowed to complete his eight years as others did. We must not go back to the dark days of killings and insecurity in Akwa Ibom. “Our group, with members which cut across the 31 local government areas of Akwa Ibom State resident in Lagos, has vowed to ensure their votes count and are protected in favour of Governor Udom Emmanuel come 2019.” Etim advised all members who successfully transferred their voters cards from Lagos to Akwa Ibom to visit INEC offices in their respective local councils to pick up their PVCs which are being released in batches and verify their names in their units to be able to vote next year for Udom Emmanuel, while advising politicians to play the game by the rules devoid of killings and other vices inimical to democracy and smooth transition.
