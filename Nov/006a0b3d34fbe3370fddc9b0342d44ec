Awka – Godwin Ezeno, the president-general of Akpo Development Association and candidate of the Young Progressives Party for Aguata 1 State Constituency, Anambra State, in the 2019 general election, has said that the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) is dead and has no hope of rallying the Igbo nation. He said the Young Progressives Party (YPP) has come as a veritable and credible alternative to fill the gap created by APGA as well as provide viable platform for the Igbo man to pursue his political ambitions. Ezeno stated that many people went to APGA with high hopes but unfortunately the organizers of the game did not give aspirants a level playing ground, he stressed that that was how his ambition was dashed on the platform of APGA. The leader of Akpo Development Association, who granted an exclusive interview to DAILY INDEPENDENT in Akpo on Thursday on his travails during APGA primary election, disclosed that in spite of his ordeals in APGA, he was urged on by his people not to relent in pursuit of his political ambitions. He explained that the choice of YPP was borne out of the fact that the political party believes in service to the nation and it was the most vocal political party across the country at the moment. According to him, the intent was to develop APGA into a national party but unfortunately the reverse was the case, pointing out that the party’s slogan “Be Your Brother’s Keeper” was an illusion because he didn’t see anything close to being one’s brother’s keeper in the party. He added that if the party were sincere, it wouldn’t have allowed people to spend the huge sums to chase shadows in the party. He was of the view that they would have told many of them not to waste their money because they had anointed their preferred candidates. “if they informed me that they had anointed somebody, will I be wasting my money? Do you know how much we spent officially and then you talk about the unofficial expenses. It was colossal! “
