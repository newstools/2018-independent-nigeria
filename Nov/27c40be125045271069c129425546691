Lagos – Alhaji Muhammed Bello, the Minister of Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, has enjoined corps members to assist the Federal Government through sensitization of the electorates to discourage vote buying among Nigerians. He stated this in a message during the closing ceremony of 2018 Batch “C” Stream One Orientation Course held at NYSC Orientation Camp in Kubwa, Abuja. He described buying and selling of votes as acts of criminality, adding that there was the need for Nigerians to exercise their franchise without inducement. Bello appealed to the corps members to be non-partisan in the discharge of their electoral assignments as the 2019 general election approaches. Represented at the ceremony by the Director, Finance and Administration, FCT, Hajiya Sefiya T. Umar, he tasked corps employers not to reject corps member posted to their establishments but should rather provide an enabling environment for them. “I charge you to embark on a sensitization spree to intimate the electorate on the criminality of vote buying and selling of votes. Also, educate them on the need to defend their votes and to vote according to their conscience at all times. “The political landscape is agog and you are expected to be apolitical and non-partisan in all ramifications,” Bello said. Speaking further, the FCT Minister urged the corps members to utilize the skills acquired while in camp and embrace post-camp training to perfect their skills towards becoming wealth creators. NYSC FCT Coordinator, Mallam Balama Bello, urged the corps members to be patriotic and behave responsibly in their place of primary assignments. “Bear in mind that the NYSC and the FCTA has an intrinsic reward system for hard work and excellence and reorder your choices to leverage the integrity and status advancement drive,” Balama said. A total of 2,815 corps members participated in the orientation course at FCT Orientation Camp, Kubwa.
