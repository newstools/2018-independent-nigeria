Lagos – Coach Thomas Dennerby of the Super Falcons has said that playing the Indomitable Lioness of Cameroon in Tuesday’s first semifinal at the ongoing Africa Women Cup of Nations in Ghana would be a huge test to his side’s resolve to defend their title. The two countries will be squaring up against each other after Nigeria finished second in Group B behind leaders, South Africa, while Cameroon emerged top of Group A ahead of Mali, who will play the Bayana Bayana in the second semifinal. Speaking to the media after the team’s training on Sunday, Dennerby noted that Cameroon would present a very formidable opposition to his side and concluded that Nigeria’s resolve to defend the title they won in Yaoundé two years ago would be fully put to test. The ten-time winners must defeat Cameroon to be doubly sure of booking a World Cup ticket, as only three countries would qualify for the Mundial slated for France next year. “I know that everybody will want us to sustain the current tempo that saw us defeat both Zambia and Equatorial Guinea in great fashion. “That is also our plan because we hope to defend the title and also qualify for the World Cup. But our opponents in the semifinal (Cameroon) are not pushovers. In fact, we respect them a lot and I believe that if we really plan to defend this cup, we must understand that Cameroon will put us to test,” he said.
