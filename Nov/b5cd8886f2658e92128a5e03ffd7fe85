The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA) has reiterated its firm belief in the rule of law and the need for regulatory agencies like the National Lottery Regulatory Commission (NLRC) to be civil and law abiding in the discharge of their responsibilities. NECA maintained that the NLRC could not constitute itself into an accuser and a judge in its own case in which it has erroneously equated sales promotion to lottery. Mr. Olusegun Oshinowo, the Director-General of NECA stated this yesterday in a statement. Oshinowo also deplored what he described as gestapo-like manner in which the NLRC under the leadership of Lanre Gbajabiamila, allegedly aided by a lorry load of armed policemen, marched on the premises of Nigerian Breweries Plc to shut down the company over a purported failure to pay a “spurious commission to the agency.” He insisted that the act was “despicable, indecent and very uncivil in a democratic dispensation with well developed conflict resolution mechanism.” He added that the NLRC had done incalculable damage to the image of the current administration, which he said was trying to promote the rule of law and improve ease of doing business in the country. He said: “In one breath, the government is advertising Nigeria as the destination of choice for investment and in another breath NLRC is destroying what government is trying to build at a crucial time like this that the current administration is seeking to renew its electoral mandate.” It would be recalled that NECA, the voice of business in Nigeria, had instituted a legal action against the commission in the on-going case CA/A/207/2016: NECA & 1 Or vs. AG Federation & 3 Ors seeking for the Court’s interpretation of the scope of the mandate of the NLRC, which is restricted to regulating lottery and does not extend to “Promos.”
