OWERRI – With the countdown to the 2019 general elections, a call has gone to Nigerian youths to resist any temptation by unscrupulous politicians who might want to use them as thugs during the polls. The call was contained in a statement issued in Owerri, Imo State capital, by Chidiebere Ernest Onuoha, the National Publicity Secretary and Head of Research and Development of Atikulation, one of the support groups of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Onuoha said that experience had shown that violence during or after elections are usually caused and perpetrated by some gullible young people who make themselves willing tools of destruction in the hands of desperate politicians and advised the youths to shun such acts as it would jeopardise their lives and future of the nation. Insisting that campaigns for the 2019 polls must be issue-based and not on petty sentiments, vote buying, rigging or thuggery, Onuoha charged the youths to follow the coming political debates for the presidential candidates to enable them make an informed choice. He explained that “Atikulation” is an open platform for all well meaning Nigerians especially the youth yearning for good governance and an effective paradigm shift from the old order.
