Lagos – Ngozi Okobi, one of the workaholic midfielders of the Super Falcons currently campaigning at the 2018 Africa Women Cup of Nations in Ghana, has said that Nigeria would likely retain the title they won two years ago in Cameroon. The midfielder was speaking ahead of their semifinal clash with the Indomitable Lioness of Cameroon in a match that will be played in Accra, explain that right from the time they left Nigeria, their plan was to come and successfully defend their title. She ruled out any form of pressure on the part of the team heading into the match against the Group A leaders, saying that there was nothing to be scared of. “We are not under any kind of pressure because I believe in the girls we have in the team. Both young and old, we have experienced and younger players who can actually play good football. I don’t think anyone is scared of (in the semifinal against Cameroon). “I still see us lifting the trophy because that is our aim, as well as qualifying to the World Cup. Why should we just come to a tournament and play some matches and go back home? It is not possible. We are here with the trophy and we have to take it back home. “I will definitely bring out my best. I need to bring out my best, like the real me who makes things happen on the pitch, make the players happy because they believe so much in me. So I need to bring out my all for the team,” she said.
