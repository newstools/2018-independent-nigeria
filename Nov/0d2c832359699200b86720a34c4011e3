The leader of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria otherwise known as ‘Shiites’, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, has been likened to an animal. He was metaphorically referred to as an animal by the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai. This was said when the Governor appeared as the guest of an interview programme on Channels Television. He said: “We the difference betwwen IMN and Boko Haram. I know this movement. I know El-Zakazaky. We were students at Ahmadu Bello University together. We were both active in the Muslim Students’ Society. So, I know the animal I am dealing with. “Many of those making comments on this do not even know the history. I was at ABU when El-zakazy was dismissed. When asked if the statement was not denigrating, he replied: “It is not denigrating. It is a statement, an idiom.” The IMN leader and his wife are currently in the custody of the Department of State Security until January 22, 2019.
