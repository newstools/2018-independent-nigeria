Godwin Obaseki, the Edo State governor, has made a case for stronger synergy among all segments of society to tackle the security challenges facing the country. Obaseki made the submission during the Nigerian Army’s Research and Innovation Exhibition/Trade Fair, organised by the Nigerian Army as part of activities lined up for the Chief of Army Staff Conference, taking place in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, earlier scheduled to hold in Benin City. He noted that security was all encompassing and required sustained collaboration of the different segments of society and “cannot be viewed from one prism.” He described the exhibition as “illuminating and promising, particularly when you look around and see that majority of the people who are exhibiting their products here today are Nigerians who have defied all odds to overcome the challenges facing the nation. “I want to assure you that when next we come for exhibitions like this in a few years’ time, given the focus of our administration, particularly in the area of providing the enabling environment for our people to actualise their dreams, we will be able to produce more of these goods and services required to promote our national security”. The governor commended the Army and Security Chiefs for their effort at organising the exhibition, which he described as successful. Chief of Transformation and Innovation in the Nigerian Army, Major General Felix Agugo, said the exhibition/trade fair was organised to galvanise all stakeholders in the security sector to generate ideas, capacity and equipment to enhance the nation’s security. He said 80 companies, institutions, enterprises participated in the exhibition and showcased what they have, to make the nation a better place to live in with regards to peace and security. Items exhibited included bulletproof vests, uniforms, signals equipment, accessories, clothes, shoes, among others.
