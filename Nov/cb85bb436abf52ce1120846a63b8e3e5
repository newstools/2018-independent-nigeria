Wife of the Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial Candidate, Dr. (Mrs.) Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, has charged women of voting age in the state to show their strength in numbers in the forthcoming general election in order to get their deserved recognition. Sanwo-Olu made the call on November 29th 2018 at the Ikoyi campaign office of her husband during a meeting with groups of women led by female local council development area chairmen and women group in the Babajide Sanwo-Olu Independent Campaign Group. She said it was high time the women in the state got more organised and united in politics, adding that politics and governance is about participation not about women making demands without engaging the system. Sanwo-Olu noted that women in Nigeria and Lagos State in particular would have more representations in all arms of government both in appointive and elwective position when they show strength with their numbers in areas of mobilization and actual voting.
