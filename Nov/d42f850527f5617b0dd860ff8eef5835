Lagos – Super Falcons defender, Rita Chikwelu has declared that she and her colleagues in the Nigerian team are working really hard in order to retain the Africa Women Cup of Nations later this month in Ghana. “Our target in Ghana is to win the tournament again”, said Chikwelu. She said the lack of top friendly matches would not affect their chances of a successful title defence in Ghana. Chikwelu added that all the players are happy at the camp in Epe and insists everything is in place and just right to help them achieve their target of winning a ninth continental title in Ghana. The veteran defender went on to thank Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and Lagos State government for providing quality welfare and facilities to make their plans move on course better and smoother. “We are happy being here and very grateful to the NFF and the people of Lagos for offering us this beautiful facility. “We are preparing hard and not worried about playing top friendly games. I can assure you that will not affect us”, she said. Meanwhile, Coach Thomas Dennerby has said he is banking on flexibility in his squad, which will make it possible for them to play different formations at every point in a match. With weeks tuning into days ahead of the AWCON 2018 in Ghana, Dennerby said he believes his players’ creative efforts will help them when the competition begins. The Falcons will first play against old rivals, South Africa on November 18 in their first group match and Dennerby is already thinking big for victory. He reckons that his side will carry the day because of their technical depth, which makes it possible for the team to switch defence into attack at the snap of a finger. “I am happy with how the players have been able to adapt to my tactics. “They have shown an encouraging ability to learn and apply, which makes it is easy for the team to switch formations easily, and they are not goal shy.”
