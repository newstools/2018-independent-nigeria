Lagos – Asisat Oshoala, Super Falcons striker, ended her goal drought in the ongoing Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Ghana with a hat-trick in the 6-0 mauling of Equatorial Guinea on Saturday. Oshoala, who missed several chances in Nigeria’s first two games, redeemed her image, scoring Nigeria’s second, third and fourth goals against harmless Equatorial Guinea. Francesca Ordega opened scoring in the eight minute with Oshoala doubling Falcons’ lead four minutes later. She increased her team’s tally to three on the 21st minute and scored her third goal on 32nd minute. The first half ended with Falcons leading with four goals. And on resumption, Oparanozie made it five with just three minutes played while Captain Rita Chikwelu ended the goal rush three minutes after the hour mark. The win qualified Nigeria for the semi-final of the tournament and will play Cameroon that topped group A on Tuesday. South Africa that topped Group B with seven points will play group A second placed team, Mali, also on Tuesday. Nigeria need to beat Cameroon on Tuesday for her to qualify for the 2019 Women’s FIFA World Cup in France. In the second group game, third placed Zambia played 1-1 with South Africa. South Africa topped the group with seven points, Nigeria secomd with six points while Zambia are third with four points and Equatorial Guinea were pointless. Meanwhile, Mali made history by advancing to the semi-finals for the first time thanks to a 3-2 victory over Algeria on Friday. The result saw them go through alongside Cameroon who held host Ghana 1-1 in Accra, effectively ending the campaign of the Black Queens. Cameroon topped the group with seven points, Mali on six points, Ghana with four points and Algeria in that order pointless.
