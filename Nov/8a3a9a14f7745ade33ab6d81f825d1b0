Abuja – The Senate has adopted a new method of funding the 2019 general elections as against the earlier method of getting the total sum of N242, 245.050.10 from the service wide vote (special intervention programme). The total sum of N242, 245.050.10 approved by the National Assembly would be shared for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies for the 2019 elections. Reversing its earlier decision, the Senate on Wednesday said only N121,122,525,050 would now be taken from the service wide votes while the balance of N121,122,525,050 would be taken from 30 ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs). This decision followed the adoption of the new report submitted by its committee on appropriation and the request of the joint committees of both chambers of the National Assembly on INEC and electoral matters that a sum of N242.2 billion be vired for INEC and other agencies for successful preparation and conduct of the 2019 polls. While the Ministry of Power, Housing, and Works became the biggest casualty as it lost a whopping N25. 527 billion of its N714.668 billion in the 2018 budget to election budget and left with N689. 141 billion, other MDAs also suffered loss from their budgets. Other affected ministries are the Federal Ministry of Water Resources, which is to forfeit N12,954,799,500; Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, N11,057,594,240; Federal Ministry of Education, N10,238,444,433; Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, N7,466,143,244 and Ministry of Budget and National Planning, which suffered a minor loss of N8,845,154,871 from its N1.776 trillion. Recall that the Joint Committees on INEC headed by Senator Suleiman Nazif had recommended virement of N189,007,272,393 to INEC; N9,481,500,000 to the Office of the National Security Adviser; N10,213,284,455 to Department of State Services; N3,573,534,500 to Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps; N27,341,317,433 to the Nigeria Police Force, and N2,628,143,320 to Nigeria Immigration Service, totalling N242,245,050,100. Leading debate on the motion titled, ‘Rescission and reconsideration of the Senate approval or virement/supplementary budget for Independent National Electoral Commission and security agencies for the conduct of the 2019 general elections,’ the Chairman of Senate Committee on Appropriation, Senator Danjuma Goje (Gombe Central), said: “Because of some obvious and imminent issues of national socio-economic importance, the virement/supplementary request cannot be implemented as earlier approved. “Recall the approval of the virement/supplementary budget for INEC and security agencies for the conduct of the 2019 general elections in the sum of N242, 245, 050,100 only, which is to be funded from the service wide votes on the 16th October, 2018-Senate resolution (S/RS/027/04/8).” The committee, according to Goje, has, accordingly, resolved to: “Rescind and reconsider its approval of the request as contained in resolution S/RS/027/04/8 in line with Order 53(6) of its Standing Order; and approve the sum of N242,245,050,100 only.” The recommendation of the Goje-led committee was unanimously approved by the Senate. However, an additional prayer was adopted to allow Senate Committee on Police Affairs investigate how the Nigeria Police Force had utilised previous allocations for election purposes in the last two general elections. The second resolution followed Senator Dino Melaye’s query of allocation of N27, 341,317,433 to the police for the purpose of the 2019 polls. Melaye had argued that such colossal amount of money was not needed by the police that had 2018 budgetary allocation. Goje said Melaye’s complaint was belated after both chambers of the National Assembly had passed the 2019 election budget. Senate President Bukola Saraki reframed Melaye’s concerns by suggesting that the police committee be mandated to look into utilisation of previous allocation to the police for election monitoring. The committee is expected to submit its report in two weeks.
