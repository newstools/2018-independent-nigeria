The Global Financing Facility (GFF) in Support of Every Woman Every Child has announced $1.005bn in contributions from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Burkina Faso, Canada, Côte d’Ivoire the European Commission, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Laerdal Global Health, the Netherlands, Norway, Qatar and the United Kingdom. The body said this would help the GFF partnership on the pathway towards expanding to as many as 50 countries with the greatest health and nutrition needs and contribute to saving and improving millions of lives by 2030. The event was an important milestone towards the goal of raising as much as $2bn to expand to a total of 50 countries; the GFF it said was expecting additional pledges from new and existing investors who are considering new multi-year commitments. The GFF is a catalyst for health financing that is helping countries to transform how they invest in women, children and adolescents because for too long, their health and nutrition has been chronically and persistently de-prioritised and underfunded—resulting in the preventable deaths of five million women and children every year.
