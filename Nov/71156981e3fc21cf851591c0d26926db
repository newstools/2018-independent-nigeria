Lagos – The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has promised to prepare the Super Falcons early ahead of the 2019 FIFA World Cup in France. Seyi Akinwunmi, the First Vice President of the NFF, in an interview, called for all-inclusive preparations for the Super Falcons, who have just qualified for the 2019 FIFA World Cup in France after defeating the Indomitable Lionesses of Cameroon in the semifinal of the 2018 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Ghana. The NFF chief, meanwhile, commended the national women team for overcoming Cameroon even as he said that the feat did not come easy, saying that the only way they could perform in France was early preparation and taking advantage of opportunities to play friendly matches. He said that the ladies had justified the confidence reposed in them by the leadership of the NFF, saying that the football house was proud of the team. Akinwunmi said that immediately after the ongoing Cup of Nations, NFF would ask for the comprehensive plan from the coach and then, they would take it from there. “I am very happy for what they have achieved even though it was not quite easy for them to overcome Cameroon. “World Cup is a different ball game and we hope to start early. After the final match on Saturday, the NFF will ask Coach Thomas Dennerby to submit his program and we will take it from there. “The only way we can perform well is for them to start early preparation and playing friendly matches at every opportunity for that,” he said. Super Falcons will take on Bayana Bayana of South Africa in Saturday’s final. While Nigeria will be hoping to win their tenth title, South Africa will be hoping to win the title for the first time.
