Lagos – Solomon Dalung, the Sports Minister, has promised to intervene and make sure that the Super Sand Eagles get the best of preparations ahead of the African championship taking place in Egypt. Dalung disclosed that he had not been aware of the sordid state of plans in place for the team by Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) for the Beach Soccer Africa Cup of Nations, but promised to take it up from there. The sports minister, it was gathered, made the pledge in response to agitated comments on social media, in which a series of posts warned that the Sand Eagles would be humiliated at Egypt 2018 next month. The Super Sand Eagles are with the defending champions, Senegal, Libya and Tanzania in the same group for the five-day tournament, for which Nigeria are two-time champions. Nigeria won the tournament in 2007 and 2009, both in South Africa, but could not win it on home soil last time out. Social media users are now worried that the Nigerian team could be in for another shock in Giza, Egypt, where they could lose out on many fronts, as the winner and runner-up will qualify for the 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup in Paraguay. However, after finding out that the Super Sand Eagles were not in camp to prepare for the competition, which kicks off on December 9, Dalung came out with a promise to intervene immediately.
