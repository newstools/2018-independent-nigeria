ABUJA – The African Students Union Parliament (ASUP) has begun a campaign to sensitise students in the higher institutions of learning in Nigeria and other African countries against the abuse of drugs and other related substances. Speaker of ASUP, Mr. Abel Kewel, who stated this in Abuja when the leadership of the students body conferred Pan African Leadership Award of Excellence on the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, Mr. Bitrus Bako Nabasu. Kewel lamented the high rate of substance abuse by students of higher learning in Africa, calling for concerted efforts to mitigate the menace. He explained that drug abuse could lead to multiple behavioural problems such as paranoia, addiction, loss of self-control, impaired judgment and aggression, among others. He decried a situation where students abused cough syrup, warning that the drugs and other related substances have both physical and psychological effects on the students who take them. Commenting on the award conferred on Nabasu, the Speaker of the ASUP said he was chosen for “contributing more than a building block towards the advancement of the noble course of pan Africanism through effective and selfless leadership skills.”
