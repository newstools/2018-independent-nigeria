Real Madrid interim coach Santiago Solari has claimed his only focus is on Sunday’s match at Celta Vigo, with decision time over his future fast approaching. La Liga rules state Solari must either be confirmed as full-time manager or vacate his interim role, with the deadline for the decision on Monday. Asked whether the Vigo match was decisive for his hopes of becoming Madrid manager, Solari said: “In this sport every game is decisive, for many reasons. “If you lose points you cannot recover them. We can only focus on tomorrow, and that is what I am doing. The job long term is not up to us. We will have to be just as serious and focused as we have been. The players want to get these three points, to cut the gap.” Solari, who has won all three matches in charge after Julen Lopetegui was sacked following a 5-1 defeat to Barcelona, has made a number of big decisions during his time as interim coach. Thibaut Courtois has been picked ahead of Keylor Navas, Brazilian starlet Vinicius Jr. has been introduced to the first team while Isco has been a substitute in all three games Solari has managed. “I don’t know how he has taken it,” Solari said. “Have you spoken with him? I guess he has taken it professionally. We know Isco’s quality and the special player he is. He is training to return to top shape after his operation. “All of us inside football know that you must train at the maximum possible to then be available to play. The coach picks the team and the players know that clearly.”
