LAGOS – The National Pension Commission (PenCom) says contributors under its Micro Pension Scheme to be rolled out in 2019 would have access to 40 per cent of the total contributions after three months of commencement. Mr Peter Aghahowa, the Head, Corporate Communications, made the disclosure on Friday at the commission’s special day at the just ended Lagos International Trade Fair. Aghahowa said the scheme, a voluntary contribution, allowed participants to have the options of saving monthly, weekly and also daily, depending on the types of their businesses. The PenCom spokesman said that the scheme also allowed some flexibilities because of the peculiarities of the informal sector. He said: “As they save, 60 per cent will be locked and fixed, while 40 per cent will be available at a certain time for raining day. “This is because the commission understands the fact that businesses can’t always be rosy. “The 40 per cent allows contributors to have access to the contingent aspect of the scheme.” According to him, the commission and the licensed operators have also reached out to different strata of the public such as different associations, markets, and Small and Medium Scale Enterprises. “It is a continuous effort because as a regulator, PenCom and licensed operators are collectively making efforts in ensuring that the populace is aware of the scheme. “Collectively, we hope that in the next one month before the commencement of the Micro Pension Scheme in 2019, the intensity of the awareness would have increased.
