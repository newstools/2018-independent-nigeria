The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) yesterday gave highlights for planting beans seed across the country in line with the Nigerian Industrial Standards (NIS) and Codes of Practices. Osita Aboloma, the Director General of SON in a statement to commend a consumer for reporting a beans vendor who preserves beans with pesticide, stated that the standards are relevant Nigeria Industrial Standards and Codes of Practice for beans along the value chain, to take care of issues concerning the proper preservation of the crop from planting to the table while also assuring the safety of consumers. He enumerated the Standard and Codes of Practice as follows; Standard for Dry Beans (NIS 1030: 2018) Code of Good Agricultural Practice: Planting of Dry Beans (NCP 065: 2018), Code of Good Practice: Harvesting of Dry Beans (NCP 067: 2018) Code of Practice for Packaging of Dry Beans (NCP 064: 2018), Code of Practice: Storage and Transportation of Dry Beans (NCP 066: 2018) The SON helmsman urged Nigerians in general to take greater interest in their welfare by reporting to relevant regulatory and security agencies any suspected unwholesome, sub-standard or life endangering products or practices. He, however, commended the consumer who reported to the police the beans vendor for using a pesticide for the preservation of the crop on sale. According to him, such individual and collective awareness by consumers in general are essential for effective standards implementation and enforcement in Nigeria.
