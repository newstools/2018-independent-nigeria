ADO-EKITI – Tosin Oribamise, a two-time African Junior Table Tennis champion, has lamented her inability to procure standard kits for training. The female table tennis sensation decried the poor condition of her training room in Ado-Ekiti, which she said was not ventilated. Oribamise spoke as a panelist during a two-day Ekiti Future Summit with the theme: ‘Open for Business: Investing in Ekiti’. Oribamise, who represented Nigeria at the 2016 World Junior Championships in South Africa, was at the World Junior and Cadet Circuit in Egypt 2015 where she won 2 gold, 1 silver and 2 bronze medal. She was also at the Africa Junior Championships in Algeria in 2016 and won 1 silver and 3 bronze medal. According to her, “I train in a very small classroom without windows at SUBEB Primary School, Ado Ekiti. It is a very small classroom with no space to train for all those skills. There is no training hall in this state.” She bemoaned lack of motivation and encouragement for sports in the country, urging governments to come to the aid of sportsmen by way of addressing their challenges. “This has really been affecting me. When you play with a bad table at home and you go out to compete on a standard table, before you will be able to acclimatise, the first day will have gone. It is really affecting my participation and performance at the international level,” she said.
