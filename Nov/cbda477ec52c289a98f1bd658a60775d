The Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has set up a 7-man Committee to map out a clear and defined funding structure for the National Sports Federations. The Committee was set up on Thursday November 8, 2018 by the Minister of Youth and Sports Barrister Solomon Dalung while addressing National Sports Federations Presidents on funding for their local and international competitions. The members are the President of the Wrestling Federation of Nigeria Hon. Daniel Igali, President of the Taekwondo Federation Mrs Margaret Binga, Mr. Frank Orbih of the Badminton Federation,  AFN President Ibrahim Gusau, Yahaya Muhammed of the Weightlighting Federation,  Hon Suleiman Yahaya Kwande of the Nigeria Football Federation and Evangelist Solomon Ogba of the Nigeria Olympic Committee are to submit a report within seven days on a clear and defined funding structure for National Sports Federations. “The report will include designing an appropriate funding architecture for sports federations, approvals and payments of subventions to Federations, budgetary allocations, bridging the gap and conflict between the Ministry and Federations and the role of the Ministry, Secretaries and federations in sports development” Dalung also noted that up till date, less than thirty percent of Federations were yet to deposit copies of their Constitutions as endorsed by their various congresses and urged them to do so immediately to avoid conducting the next Federations’ election with the Ministry’s Guidelines. Earlier, the President Nigeria Olympic Committee Habu Gumel harped on the need for federations’ Presidents and Secretaries to have their responsibilities well spelt out to avoid conflict or duplication of roles.
