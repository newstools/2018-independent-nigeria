Lagos – Players and officials of Rangers International F.C the ‘Flying Antelopes’ have set a high target for themselves as they kick start the challenge to win the Total/CAF Confederation Cup with a first round, preliminary round date against Ethiopian side, Defence Force S.C. The encounter billed for the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, ‘The Cathedral’ Enugu on Wednesday (today) will be handled by Ali Moussa Mohammed from Niger with three of his countrymen on the trip for the game that is fixed to kick off at 16.00 hours (4:00PM). After a not too impressive show last time out on the continent that saw the Enugu side exit the second tier continental competition after dropping from the more glamorous, CAF Champions League, the current management of the team led by Prince Davidson Owumi is leaving no stone unturned in pushing as far as the competition can go. Coach Olugbenga Ogunbote is optimistic of leading his ‘Six Star Generals’ to an emphatic win in Enugu to make the reverse fixture a mere formality. With a backline anchored around teenage sensation, Akpos Adubi and hard tackling Senegalese defence marshal, Ousmane Sane with adequate backup from Semiu Liadi and ever reliable skipper of the side, Okey Odita, the Nigerian Cup champion can boast of a very mean and tight cover for the man between the sticks. “I believe that we have done enough within the shot time available to build a team that will defend and fly the country’s flag very high in the competition. With little knowledge of our opponent, we are condemned to play our game and get the needed result that will make the return leg inconsequential. “I call on our teaming supporters to come out in their numbers and cheer us to a good win,” said coach Ogunbote. Rangers’ will also be banking on the midfield quartet of Ajani Ibrahim, Chiamaka Madu, Ugonna Uzochukwu and Ugochukwu Ugwuoke to provide the needed ammunition for forward liners to harvest goals in this competition which trophy have eluded the country just as the Enugu landlords aim to drink with a continental trophy since its first and only triumph in 1977 when ‘Chairman’ Christian Chukwu (Mfr) led his lieutenants to conquer the continent.
