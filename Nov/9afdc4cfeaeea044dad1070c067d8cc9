Lagos – Victor Ikpeba, the former Super Eagles forward, has revealed that the team would be unbeatable at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon provided Coach Gernot Rohr works on the team’s linkage from midfield to attack. The 2007 Africa Footballer of the Year, who spoke on the backdrop of the team’s goalless draw with the Cranes of Uganda in a tune up match played at the Stephen Keshi Stadium in Asaba, Delta State, on Tuesday, said that transition from the midfield to attack remained the major weakness of the team. He noted that if this issue was solved, the Super Eagles would be a team to beat in Cameroon, even as he admitted that with the return of players like Odion Ighalo and Captain John Mikel Obi, the team would be stronger. “The transition of this team from the midfield to the attack remains their weakest link. We are not quick enough. If we get our transition right, we will be unbeatable in Cameroon. “We have to do well in Cameroon after missing out on two editions. We will be a threat in Cameroon with the qualities we have, but we must be ready. Egypt, Mali, Senegal, Tunisia are there; they will be there to compete,” he said. Ikpeba charged some of the new players in the team such as Semi Ajayi, Victor Osimhen as well as Samuel Chukwueze and Mikel Agu to show enough hunger, even as he admitted that with the performance of Samuel Kalu, Nigerians were not missing the recently retired Victor Moses.
