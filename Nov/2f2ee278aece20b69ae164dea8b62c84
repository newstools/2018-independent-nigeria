Super Eagles’ defender, Ola Aina, has admitted that Nigeria must work hard in order to beat South Africa in their 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Saturday in Johannesburg. He also admitted that South Africa would be tough but will be a worthy opposition for Nigeria. “We just have to work hard, play good football, fight for each other on the pitch and hope for a bit of good fortune because it’s needed sometimes. “It’s a great stadium as we saw in the World Cup in 2010. South Africa have got a fantastic team, they’re also very attacking, so it should be a good test. I’m really looking forward to it,” Aina said. Aina has played seven times for Nigeria and will be targeting his eighth cap when they tackle South Africa in Johannesburg.
