Lagos – Former Lagos State Police Commissioner, Abubakar Tsav, has said the recent allegation made by governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, against him was an attempt to silence him. In a chat with INDEPENDENT today, Tsav said he would continue to defend his integrity without fear or favour, stressing his determination not be intimidated. “Case of injurious falsehood filed against me by AG of BNS acting on orders of Gov Ortom came up before Chf MagCt 1 Mkd today. “The Defence Council made Preliminary objections based on Constitutional infringement & quoted Sup/Ct Authorities to buttress this. “Case adjourned to 12/12/2018 for ruling. This is the third time I’m appearing before same Court on same charge. “Ortom is misusing the judiciary to silence me but I can’t be silenced,” he said.
