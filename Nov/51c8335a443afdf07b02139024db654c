A Kubwa Grade I Area Court on Friday sentenced a 20-year-old sales boy, Rejoice Ugwu to eight months in prison for stealing a windscreen of a car worth six million Naira. The judge, Malam Abdulwahab Mohammed, who gave Ugwu an option to pay a fine of N20, 000 after he pleaded guilty, warned him to desist from committing crimes. Mohammed, however, ordered that Ugwuâ€™s accomplice one Chukwuebuka Nwankwo be remanded in prison custody until Dec. 11, for the hearing of bail application. Police charged Nwankwo for receiving the car windscreen. He pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor, Mr Noel Omeji told the court that one Kelvin Eze, petitioned the Inspector-General of Police and FCT Police Command on July 20. Omeji said that while taking stock of supplies in his shop, he discovered that a car windscreen and other goods valued at N6million were missing. The prosecutor said that when Eze asked Ugwu, he admitted to stealing the windscreen and selling same to Nwankwo and three others at large. The prosecutor said the offence contravened the provisions of Sections 97, 289 and 317 of the Penal Code.
