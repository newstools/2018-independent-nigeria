Coach Gernot Rohr has declared that the two Nigerian goals disallowed by Referee Bakary Gassama of The Gambia in Saturday’s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier between the Super Eagles and the Bafana Bafana of South Africa inside the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg were genuine goals. Consequently, Rohr does not think it was a correct decision by the referee to rule out two legitimate goals scored by the Super Eagles in their 1-1 draw with South on Saturday afternoon. Nigeria had the ball in the net in the 8th minute but the effort was disallowed with the linesman adjudging Ahmed Musa to have been in an offside position during the build-up. Replays clearly showed that it was a wrong decision by the match officials as Musa was onside when he was put through on goal. The second episode also involved the Super Eagles captain, it looked as if the former Leicester City man had put Nigeria 2-1 up after a delightful pass from Iwobi but the flag went up again. “The goal scored by our captain Musa was a good goal and not offside. I think it was a wrong call by the officials but I don’t criticise the referee,’’ Rohr was quoted as saying by an online medium,” Rohr told BBC Sport. ‘’We got the result we needed.’’ Meanwhile, the Super Eagles players and officials landed in Asaba on Sunday morning ahead of Tuesday’s international friendly against Uganda at the Stephen Keshi Stadium.
