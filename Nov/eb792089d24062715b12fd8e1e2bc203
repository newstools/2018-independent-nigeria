ENUGU – Dr Abdullahi Bichi Baffa, the Executive Secretary, Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND), has emphasised the need for collective efforts from all stakeholder to revive the education sector in Nigeria. He stated this on Wednesday while delivering a lecture titled, ‘A sustainable funding model for education in Nigeria’, at the 32nd to 42nd convocation lecture of the Institute of Management and Technology (IMT), Enugu. According to him, political will was necessary to revitalise education sector in Nigeria, but was not sufficient,  stressing that “only collective will is sufficient to change the face of education in Nigeria.” He added: “If we must improve the education system in this nation, all stakeholders must contribute because education for all is a responsibility of all. We must not always wait and throw blame on the government on the problem facing education sector. But, all hands must be on deck to revitalise education sector in our nation. “We must always rally support for our leaders, federal, state and local government as well as accept and implement all government policies and ensure sustainability of the policies in order to turn the fortunes of education system around.” Dr Baffa, who also called for huge investment in education system, said the sector needed N11.5 trillion annually to function effectively, adding, “these money must not come from government alone, but all well-to-do Nigerians should support the government by investing massively to change the face of education in the country. He called on all state governments to provide free basic education for all school children, lamenting the high rate of out-of-school children across the country, saying, “nobody will solve the problem for us unless we do it.”
