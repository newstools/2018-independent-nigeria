ABUJA – Abubakar Bawa Bwari, Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development (MMSD), has expressed willingness to partner the Czech Republic in the growth of the mining sector in line with the economic diversification and job creation agenda of the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. Bwari spoke when Mare Skoll, the Ambassador of Czech Republic, and his team paid him a courtesy visit in Abuja. He assured the guests that Nigeria would collaborate with friendly countries to engage in mining related activities to fully explore and tap the potentials and opportunities that exist in the sector. He expressed delight at their visit, noting that Nigeria has the potentials and the wherewithal to develop the country to the class of other mineral destinations like South Africa, Canada, Australia, China and some European countries that have excelled in the sector. To realise this, the minister said the ministry developed a roadmap with the aim to attract and enlighten investors that would in turn assist in maximising the opportunities available within the sector to enable the country attain its rightful position in the sector. Bwari explained that interested investors could key into the various value chains such as exploration, exploitation, processing, and trading of minerals that are available in the country. He said investors also have the option of importing mining equipment either to lease or sell to Nigerians for exploration, exploitation, refining, and processing of minerals.
