Gernot Rohr has invited Enyimba goalkeeper, Theophilus Afelokhai, as replacement for the injured Francis Uzoho for the Super Eagles’ 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against South Africa and an international friendly against Uganda this month. Uzoho,20, is one of the three goalkeepers invited by t Rohr for the Super Eagles’ next two games but he pulled out of the ties due to injury sustained while in action for Elche in Sunday’s 5-1 loss to Cadiz. Uzoho has been the first choice Nigeria goalkeeper since making his debut against Argentina in a pre-World Cup friendly in November 2017. The Deportivo La Coruna loanee has played 12 times for the Super Eagles, conceding 12 goals and keeping five clean sheets but will sit out the next two games. Afelokhai, who has been Enyimba’s first choice goalkeeper this season, is making a return to the Super Eagles for the first time in three years. Hehas been outstanding for Enyimba this season helping the two-time CAF Champions League winner reach the semi-final of this year’s CAF Confederation Cup. Super Eagles lost their opening Nations Cup qualifier 2-0 to South Africa June 17, 2017 in Uyo. However, Super Eagles goalkeeper trainer, Aloy Agu, has allayed fears that the absence of Uzoho would create a big vacuum. He said on Tuesday that though his absence was a huge loss, but that there was no cause for alarm. “It’s a huge loss, but there is no cause for alarm. Theophilus will join up with Daniel Akpeyi and Ikechukwu Ezenwa for the two games against South Africa and Uganda.”
