Enugu – The Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo says Nigeria’s problem is not ethnic or religious but electing a visionary leader with conscience for transformation of the country. Speaking at the formal launch and book review of former Governor of Enugu State, Sulivan Chime titled “An honour to serve: Enugu State in the Sulivan years” held in Enugu on Friday, Prof Osinbajo condemned the act of some elite who are using religious, ethic and tribal sensitive to cause problem in the country due to their selfish interest. He described Sulivan Chime as a man of integrity and good conscience who impacted positively in the lives of the less-privileged in the state during his eight years in office. He said, “Governor Chime and the former Governor of Lagos State Babatunde Fashola through their developmental projects changed the faces of their states and improved the living standard of the people. All Sulivan did during his eight years was not about him but about his people and today it’s on record for the unborn generation to know and benefit,” he said.
