Lagos – South Africa’s Bayana Bayana only wish is to beat Nigeria’s Super Falcons in Saturday’s 2018 Women’s Africa Cup of nations final in Accfra, Ghana The team’s coach, Desiree Ellis, is optimistic that her players would achieve this feat on the premise of beating Nigeria 1-0 in their group opening game last week. “We are not a team that talks much in the media. We will work together as a team and plan again. And hope to execute the plan because that’s all it is about. “We have never won the Women’s AFCON title before and we are going to give it shot and play very well to beat Nigeria in the final. “It is going to be tough because that will be the second time both teams would be meeting in this championship but we are ready to play out our hearts and see what happens at the end of the encounter,” said Ellis. This is the fourth time South Africa have reached the final of the flagship women’s competition. And Ellis will be seeking to make history by winning the ultimate after qualifying for the World Cup. In their three previous final appearances, South Africa lost to Nigeria in 2000, before suffering defeats to Equatorial Guinea in 2008 and four years later.
