Captain Onome Ebi has revealed that Super Falcons are highly motivated to beat Equatorial Guinea so as to qualify for the semi-final of the ongoing 2018 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations and retain their trophy at the ongoing championship in Ghana. Falcons, who lost their opening game 1-0 to South Africa restored hope of retaining their title with a 4-0 spanking of She-Polopolo of Zambia on Wednesday. The team must win today to qualify for the semis. Ebi in an interview said that the ball was on their court to beat Equatorial Guinea and qualify for the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup in France. She said this on the premise that the NFF had done their own part, saying, victory over Zambia on Wednesday only meant the team was gradually returning to great shape. “We are getting back to shape. In the first game against South Africa, it was not the Super Falcons that Africa knew that turned up. Defeat made us to talk hard to ourselves. I think we are getting back to the form known of Super Falcons, the champions. We are not there yet but we are still pushing ourselves to reach our level. I believe our third game will definitely be much better.” The defender said that it had never crossed her mind that the Super Falcons would leave the tournament at the group stage. “I never thought about that. I don’t think that is possible because to me I see us in the semi-finals already. I have strong faith in the team that we are going to beat Equatorial Guinea and then we will take the knockout stage one match at a time. “Nigerians should keep praying for us. They should keep believing in the Super Falcons because we are here for the trophy and we are here to qualify for the World Cup. I believe that with hard work and with God on our side, we are going to achieve our twin objectives.”
