LAGOS – The downtrend that had characterised trading on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) persisted last week, as sustained sell offs in market bellwethers weighed on overall performance. Consequently, the All Share Index (ASI) closed in the red on three of the four trading sessions in the week, falling 1.2 per cent week-on-week to settle at 31,678.70 points. Similarly, year-to-date loss expanded to -17.2 per cent and market capitalisation shed N138.6 billion week-on-week to close at N11.6 trillion. Trading activity strengthened as average volume and value traded increased 24.8 per cent and 150.7 per cent to 320.5 million units and N5.8 billion respectively. The top traded stocks by volume were Zenith Bank (648.1m units), Diamond Bank (138.1m units) and Oando (95.3m units) while Zenith Bank (N15.6bn) – accounting for 62.2 per cent of total value traded in the week, Guaranty Trust Bank (N1.6bn) and Nigerian Breweries (N1.6bn) topped trades by value. The week started on a positive note as buy interest in market bellwethers – Nigerian Breweries and Nestle Nigeria – lifted the benchmark by 0.51 per cent on Monday. However, sell pressures on Dangote Cement, Guaranty Trust Bank and Ecobank Transnational Incorporated reversed previous gains as the All Share Index (ASI) shed 0.78 per cent on Wednesday. On Thursday, the ASI marginally gained 0.05 per cent, following price appreciations in Flour Mills of Nigeria, Zenith Bank and Guaranty Trust Bank.
