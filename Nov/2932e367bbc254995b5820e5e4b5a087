AWKA – The International Society for Human Rights and the Rule of Law (Intersociety) has called for immediate and unconditional release of the 33 Igbo traders based in Nnewi arrested by the police. The group also wants the Inspector General of Police (IGP)  and the Commissioner of Police, Anambra State Command, to tender unreserved apologies to the arrested traders, their market leaders and the general public. The group said the traders, when released, must sue the IGP, the Anambra CP and the Nigeria Police Force for general damages to serve as a deterrent to other overzealous law enforcement agents and agencies. Comrade Emeka Umeagbalasi, chairman, Board of Directors, Intersociety, and Chidinma Udegbunam, in a statement, described the traders’ arrest as “a clear confirmation of selective enforcement of the law” and “racial profiling” of citizens of Igbo nation under the guise of parading the 34 persons originally pencilled down for the criminal parade. It said the leadership of the Nkwo Nnewi Motor Spare Parts Dealers Association should be singled out for commendation for not abandoning their members in such dangerous and critical hours of their ordeal. According to the group, the manner the arrest was effected smacks of “failed intelligence, bias and hate policy that led to the mistaken identity and transfer of criminal responsibility in the instant case; whereby innocent traders retiring off their market stalls and premises were unlawfully rounded up or arrested and detained and-criminally paraded as “killers”, “arsonists” and “terrorists”. Intersociety said while not condoning the criminal act of attacking police officers on duty resulting in their death or injury anywhere in Nigeria, “the rush with which the Inspector General of Police responded and flew the Force Public Relations Officer to Anambra State for the purpose of effecting the criminal parading of the arrested citizens before the media without comprehensive and conclusive investigations should be viewed with shock and condemnation.”
