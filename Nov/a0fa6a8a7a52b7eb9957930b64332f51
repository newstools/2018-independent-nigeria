ENUGU – Ken Nnamani, a former Senate President, has accused the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of fraud in the nomination of former governor Chimaroke Nnamani as its candidate for Enugu East senatorial election. Ken Nnamani, who is a chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC), said Chimaroke Nnamani could not have been lawfully nominated while out of the country. Ken vowed to resist any attempt by PDP to impose Chimaroke by proxy as candidate of the party for Enugu East senatorial poll. He spoke at the campaign flag-off of the APC candidate for the district, Prince Lawrence Eze, in Enugu. Senator Nnamani said the action of the PDP was a violation of the Electoral Act and nation’s constitution, and could send those involved to prison.
