Leonardo Jardim is under consideration by Real Madrid to be their next permanent first team coach, a source close to the former Monaco manager has told ESPN FC. Jardim, 44, won the 2016-17 Ligue 1 title with Monaco and also guided them to that season’s Champions League semifinals, but was relieved of his duties last month after a poor start to the 2018-19 campaign. Madrid are still looking for a permanent replacement for Julen Lopetegui, who was manager for 14 games at the Bernabeu. His 139 days in charge came to an end following the 5-1 Clasico defeat at Barcelona. Santiago Solari has been promoted to take interim charge of Madrid’s first team, from his position as coach of the club’s Castilla youth side, and has won both games so far — a 4-0 Copa del Rey victory at third tier Melilla, and 2-0 La Liga success at home to Valladolid. La Liga rules state that Solari cannot remain as temporary coach past the upcoming international break — so he must either be confirmed until the end of the season at least, or a new permanent coach be appointed. Other candidates reportedly under consideration for the job by Bernabeu president Florentino Perez include ex-Chelsea manager Antonio Conte, Belgium coach Roberto Martinez and Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino.
