Lagos – Gernot Rohr, the Super Eagles coach, has revealed yet another factor that has endeared Villarreal of Spain youngster, Samuel Chukwueze, to his heart, as the coach said that he was excited with the rising star’s natural left foot. Rohr, who revealed this during a radio sports programme monitored in Lagos, said that Chukwueze had brought additional options in wing play for the Super Eagles. “I am happy that we are seeing a lot from Chukwueze. He has a left foot that adds quality to our team. “At the World Cup, we had Kelechi (Iheanacho) as the team’s only left footer, then we got Jamilu Collins, now we have Chukwueze. “He has shown that he can also score, as he did last weekend with his club, and he does well in helping the defence, attack and midfield. “Chukwueze will help us in all aspects, and that’s what we want to see in the national team.” We want everyone to play together as a team”, said Rohr in the programme. The Super Eagles handler said further that Chukwueze has also shown that he can play to strict technical instructions, with committed ability to attacking and defensive duties, as well as linking with his teammates. The former coach of Gabon, Burkina Faso and Niger Republic national teams went on to acknowledged that Chukwueze is developing a knack for goals as well, which he cited in the lad’s second La Liga strike last weekend for Villarreal, against Real Betis.
