P/HARCOURT – A group, Geo-Six Movement for Atiku (GSMA),has admonished former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, to emulate Nyesom Wike, Rivers State governor and rid the country’s political terrain of the vices of  godfatherism and tribalism, which retarded the development of the country. GSMA, which commended Wike for speaking out against the godfather syndrome, which it claimed had been killing politics and hampering development in some states of the federation. Speaking during an exclusive interview in Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital, on Saturday, the group’s coordinator and the former PDP Organising Secretary, Gallant Godfrey Paul, expressed optimism that as an experienced politician, Atiku would not be controlled by any godfather if he wins next year’s election. Paul said that godfathers were setbacks to any form of development, saying the crisis currently rocking the All Progressives Congress (APC) was as a result of godfathers wanting things to go their way instead of allowing the views of the masses to prevail. He said that foisting of unpopular candidates on the masses in any election was as undemocratic as the decisions of a godfather “whose actions or inactions are always anti-people”. Speaking further, the GSMA coordinator said with the transparent process that produced Atiku as the PDP presidential candidate, “it will be difficult for anybody to throw himself up as Atiku’s godfather. “Nigerians elected the former Vice President in a transparent convention held in Port Harcourt. There was no godfather that aided his election at that convention. So, I don’t see the possibility of anybody hijacking his government if God chooses that he becomes the next president in 2019. “It is common to see that only politicians without experience and content crave for a cover from godfathers. Atiku is well-experienced. He is rich, connected and has content. I don’t see any reason why he should crave for any cover from any godfather. He will not.”
