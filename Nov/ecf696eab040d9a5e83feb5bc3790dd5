Jos – Industrial Training Fund (ITF) says it  paid over N13 billion to 1,140 employers of labour as reimbursement between September, 2016 and August, 2018. The Director-General of the Industrial Training Fund, Sir Joseph Ari, disclosed this during a meeting of the ITF Reimbursement Schedule Officers held in Port Harcourt He disclosed  that  the amount that was paid was the highest of any comparative period in the history of the Fund. He  said between September, 2016 and December, 2016, the Fund paid N2,206,296,343.34 to 275 companies while the sum of N7,515,337,391.86 was disbursed to 304 companies between January, 2017 to December 2017. He  said  216 organizations received N3,516,467,051.64 between January and August, 2018 this year . He attributed the sharp rise in the payouts to diligence and handwork of the Reimbursement Officers, and the commitment of management of the Fund to the payment of reimbursement to all contributing employees provided they meet all the conditions for such reimbursements. Ari  enumerated some of the conditions for granting reimbursement to include the payment in full of their annual training contribution, training of their workforce across all cadres, presentation of evidence of training, acceptance of students on the Students’ Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) as well as, application for reimbursement within the stipulated period. He explained that the idea behind the payment of reimbursement was to encourage employers of labor to train their workforce. “The ITF Act provides that every employer having either 5 or more employees in its establishment or less than 5 but with an annual turnover of N50 million and above, shall in respect of each calendar year, contribute one per centum of its total annual payroll to the Fund. According to him, the act also requires that the Fund might make a refund of up to 50% of the amount paid by an employer if the Fund is satisfied that the training program of the employer is in accordance with the Fund’s reimbursement schemes.” He advised employers of labour to train and empower their workers with skills noting that the human factor was the most important factor of production,adding that without qualified labor, even the most expensive machinery cannot guarantee productivity.
