Lagos – Super Falcons coach, Thomas Dennerby, is confident of retaining the Africa Womens’s Nations Cup holding in Ghana later in the month. Nigeria have won the eight out of the ten times that the championship has held. The coach, who expressed this confidence on Wednesday in Lagos, promised to release the list of 21 players for the championship on November 4. However, as at Wednesday, 15 home–based and nine overseas –based professionals have started preparations in defence of the continental crown. Charity Adule, Chinwendu Ihezuo, Osinachi Ohale, Josephine Chukwunonye, Rita Chikwelu, Ogonna Chukwudi, Ebere Orji, Chinaza Uchendu and Faith Michael were at the morning training session, while Ngozi Okobi and Halimat Ayinde came into the country on Wednesday morning. The coach, however, admitted that the Banyana Banyana of South Africa would be the tough nut in the Super Falcons group. “All things being equal, the final list of my players for the AWCON will be out on Sunday, November 4 after we must have done out homework very well. “The players are doing well in training in Epe in Lagos and hopefully we should be able to get the best of 21 out those in camp”, he said. Super Falcons are paired with perennial rivals, South Africa in Group B as well as Kenya and Zambia while hosts, Ghana, Cameroon, Mali and Algeria are in Group A. The championship runs from November 17 to December 1 in Ghana. The final will take place in Accra on December 1, with both finalists and the winner of the third-placed playoff all qualifying for the 2019 Women’s World Cup.
