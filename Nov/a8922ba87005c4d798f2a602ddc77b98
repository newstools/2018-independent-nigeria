Yenagoa – The challenge of insecurity has heightened in Bayelsa State with the killing of a female undergraduate of the Niger Delta University (NDU), Seiyefa Fred, by an armed gang in Yenagoa. The 16-year-old Seiyefa, a 100-level student, was said to have been shot by the bandits suspected to be cultists in Amarata area of the state capital at about 8pm on Thursday. The Bayelsa State Police Command confirmed the incident in a statement on Friday signed by the Police Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Asinim Butswat. It stated that Sieyefa’s assailants had attempted to dispossess her of her mobile phone and shot her in the process. “The victim was immediately rushed to the hospital where she was confirmed dead. “The police have swung into action and are working on a promising lead on the identity of the suspects, and efforts have been intensified to arrest them,” the statement said. Meanwhile, the Bayelsa State government has condemned the murder of the NDU student, describing it as “shocking, reprehensible and unacceptable.” The state government in a statement on Thursday signed by Daniel Iworiso-Markson, the Commissioner for Information and Orientation, promised to do everything to fish out her killers. It also called on the people to volunteer relevant information to the police and relevant bodies on the activities of miscreants involved in all manner of criminalities in the state. The government commiserated with the family of the late Seiyefa and assured them that her killers would not go unpunished. Residents in the state live in fear as attacks and killings by armed bandits had become daily occurrences. Despite the state government’s claim of heavy investment in security, incidents of cult-related attacks and armed robberies had escalated in the state, especially in Yenagoa and its environs.
