Lagos – South Africa international Ramahlwe Mphahlele has said that the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Nigeria on Saturday will be a tough one for both teams. He thus warned against an all-or-nothing attitude ahead of the clash at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg. “We have a very strong bond in the changing room. With some new players coming into the squad, finding such a welcoming camp makes it easier to gel into a winning team,” Mphahlele told Chiefs’ official website. “Yes, this is a must-win, but we must play our normal game according to the plan that the coach will give us to master and apply on the day. “That we beat them at home in the first leg of the qualifier last year will not count on Saturday. “This is a different ball game.  It is going to be a different thing on a different pitch,” he continued. Super Eagles will be seeking revenge against the Bafana Bafana, who defeated them 2-0 in the first leg match, which was played in Uyo in June 2017. “Nigeria are always a hard nut to crack. They have good players with experience. It is good that we are playing in front of our supporters,” he added. Meanwhile, Super Eagles players and officials arrived Johannesburg on Thursday evening. They will have a feel of the pitch today for their last training ahead of the match. Super Eagles top Group E with nine points – one ahead of South Africa, while Libya are on four points and Seychelles with a point. While the Super Eagles will play their last group match at home against Seychelles, the Bafana Bafana will play away to Libya in their last group match. A win against the Bafana Bafana will see the Super Eagles return to AFCON finals after missing the last two editions of the tournament.
