A lawyer for Aasia Bibi, a Christian woman recently acquitted of blasphemy charges after eight years on death row in Pakistan, says she would like to leave her homeland for any western country willing to issue visas for her and her family. Lawyer Saiful Malook told reporters in Frankfurt on Tuesday that the failure of any country to offer to take them is why Bibi and her family haven’t already left Pakistan,according to Daily mail. Malook said that for Bibi, who is currently at a secret location in Pakistan, “any western country would be acceptable.” Pakistan’s Supreme Court judges on Oct. 21 acquitted the 54-year-old mother-of-five of blasphemy charges, but her case has inflamed radical Islamists some of whom are calling for her death.
