The Rotary Club of Maryland, Ikeja has thrown its weight behind the campaign against Polio with a 2km walk from Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere, Lagos, to the Nigerian Ports Authority Sports Complex, Bode Thomas Street, Surulere, Lagos. As part of activities marking the event, a novelty football match concluded the campaign. The match featured the Rotary Club of Maryland team against a team of some ex-Super Eagles stars led by Henry nwosu (MON) at the Nigerian Ports Authority Sports Complex. There was also a 60-minute Para-soccer game, which also added glamour to the exercise. Super Eagles star, Wasiu Ipaye, grabbed the first goal in the 40th minute of the match that ended 4-3 against the former Eagles. In their respective remarks, Tunji Funsho, the District 9110 Nigeria, Rotary International Chairman, Polio Plus Committee, as well as the Committee Coordinator of the Drive, Abayomi Adewunmi, the President of the Club, Adeniyi Adekunle, as well as the National President, Nigerian Football and All Sports Supporters Association, Rauf Oladipupo, reiterated the need for adequate support on childrenâ€™s health and welfare, right from birth. They, however, pleaded for continued materials, financial and other support to those that were assiduously determined to save the masses from unfortunate diseases or ailments, especially Polio, ravaging some areas in Nigeria. They, therefore, charged the government and others to support the drive against and further spread of such dreadful disease, especially among children from birth, with very adequate funding and moral support in such regards at all times.
