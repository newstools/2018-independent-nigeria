Mohamed Salah has apologised to a young girl who requested an early goal from the Liverpool star in Egypt’s win over Tunisia in Alexandria. The girl tweeted a photo where she held aloft a poster that read: “Salah please score. I want to go home, I have homework.” Salah goal, however, came in the 90th minute to help the Pharaoh clinch a 3-2 victory in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. Salah, who moved past legendary Egyptian playmaker Mohamed Aboutrika in the national team scorers’ chart to third with 39 goals in 62 appearances, then responded after the game, tendering his apology. “I really tried to let you go home early, and sorry to have kept you here until the last minute. I hope your teacher tomorrow understands the situation.” Prior to the tie, Egypt and Tunisia had sealed qualifications for the Nations Cup finals but the result saw the Pharaohs move level with their visitors at the summit of Group J with 12 points from five matches. Egypt will round up their qualification campaign with a fixture against Niger, while Tunisia take on Eswatini in March 2019.
