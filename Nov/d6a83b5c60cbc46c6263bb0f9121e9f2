Russian Representatives at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) tussled with envoys from Western nations on Monday in a fight about inspecting the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The first fight came when Russian representatives presented a proposal that would block the formation of a team of experts trying to assess responsibility for chemical weapons attacks inside Syria. Russian Ambassador Alexander Shulgin said the move should be blocked because forming such a body was not within the remit of the OPCW. Representatives from Britain and the U.S. responded that Russia was trying to undermine attempts to control chemical weapons and wanted to cover up the fact that the Syrian government was responsible for the bulk of poison gas attacks. “They try to bury the truth,’’ said U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Ward. Russia also presented a proposal that would block approval of the group’s budget, arguing that it was necessary to find ways to stop the team of experts from getting financing. A vote on the budget is expected on Tuesday. OPCW members met in June for an extraordinary meeting where they agreed to investigations to find out who was responsible for chemical weapons attacks, in spite of opposition from Russia and its allies. A joint UN-OPCW team was responsible for such investigations until 2017, but its mandate ended after Russia used its veto at the UN’s National Security Council.
