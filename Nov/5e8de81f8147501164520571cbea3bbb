Manchester City avenged last seasons derby defeat with an assured performance over their Manchester rivals at the Etihad. David Silva opened the scoring after just 11 minutes when Bernardo Silva squared the ball across goal from Raheem Sterling’s cross. City striker Sergio Aguero slammed in a second shortly after half time as United looked to be sinking without trace. Substitute Romelu Lukaku looked to have given United a lifeline moment after coming off the bench though, when Ederson hauled him down for a penalty. Anthony Martial carried on his rich vein of form to reduce the deficit to a goal, but City were not done yet. The home side added a third late on when they strung together 44 passes before sub Ilkay Gundogan slotted home following another cross from Bernardo Silva to wrap up the points. Martial had a fairly frustrating afternoon, but still managed to get on the scoresheet, which shows how far he has come from the beginning of the season. When you consider he looked to be on his way out of the Old Trafford exit door in the summer, he has now made himself a key member of United’s starting XI. If he can carry on this form, the Red Devils may still have a chance of making the top four come May. Meanwhile, Man City are top of the log with 32 points and are followed by Liverpool on 30 points, and then Chelsea on 28. In the match between Arsenal and Wolverhampton at the Emirates, the home side were minutes away from a shock home defeat before Henrikh Mkhitaryan rescued a point fro them.
