Hungary supports Ukraine on many levels, and does not intend to capture Ukraine’s Zakarpattia province, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó promised in an interview with Gazeta Prawna. According to the Hungarian diplomat, there is no revisionism in his country’s policy. “These are unreasonable and false insinuations… I repeat yet again – we are are not revisionists. I dismiss such explicit accusations,” he said. According to Szijjártó, Hungary supports Ukraine by providing loans for new roads and for rehabilitation programs for soldiers from the Joint Forces Operation zone. When asked what Viktor Orbán’s government meant by sending Kyiv a memorandum stating that Ukraine is a failed state, incapable of meeting its international obligations, the minister cited poor regional coordination by Kyiv and the necessity of respecting national minorities. “We are interested in good neighborly relations and a strong, democratic Ukraine, which respects its international obligations and sees national minorities as its resources, including the Hungarian minority,” the minister commented. Szijjártó denied that Ukraine-Hungary relations were being influenced by Russia, and said that Ukraine “must avoid situations where someone else has opportunities to interfere in its internal affairs”. Earlier it was reported that Hungary wanted Ukraine to sign an agreement to protect national minorities. Hungary, Ukraine, Zakarpattia, Orban, Szijjarto
