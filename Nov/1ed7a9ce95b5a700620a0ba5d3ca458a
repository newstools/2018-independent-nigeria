Lagos – Super Falcons of Nigeria and the Indomitable Lioness of Cameroon will battle for the final slot of the ongoing 2018 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Accra as they clash in the first semifinal of the tournament. The setting will be a repeat of the 2016 final in Yaoundé where the Super Falcons defeated the Lioness 1-0 to win their eighth title. The semi-final will have not just a place in the final to fight for but a ticket to the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup in France also up for grabs, as the winner is assured of automatic qualification, while the loser will have to battle it out for a third slot from the third place match. China-based striker, Asisat Oshoala who scored a hat-trick against Equatorial Guinea in the last Group B match, is expected to find  her rhythm and be in her best form to lead the Super Falcons to the final and secure a World Cup ticket. Apart from Oshoala, who is now the nearest Nigerian player in the race against South Africa’s Thembi Kgatlana for the top goals scorer’s award at this year’s WAFCON, Francisca Ordega, Desire Oparanzozie and Rita Chikwelu are the other Falcons players that would be expected to qualify the country for the final. Already, the Minister of Youth and Sports, Barrister Solomon Dalung has urged the team to go ahead and ensure qualification for the final with an outright victory over the Lioness. “I have no doubt that you can go all the way to the final to win the tournament”, said the Minister while applauding the qualification of the team for today’s semifinal match. The Minister also assured the team of the fervent love, support and prayers of President Muhammadu Buhari, the Government and the sports -loving people of Nigeria and urged them not to disappoint them. In the second semifinal, the Banyana Banyana of South Africa will face their Malian counterparts in the second semifinal match. Nigeria placed second in Group B with six points behind South Africa who placed first with seven points.
