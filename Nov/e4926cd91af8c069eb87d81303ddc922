Lagos – Super Eagles would have broken the jinx of never defeating South Africa at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday if not for the absence of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) in their 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. The game, which ended 1-1, would have ended 3-1 in favour of the Super Eagles, if the referee had not ruled two good goals offside in the match. Replays after the game showed that the two goals that were offside, calling for the introduction of the system in African football. The absence of this technology introduced at the last World Cup in Moscow by FIFA would have awarded the two goals the referee ruled offside to Nigeria. Nigeria opened scoring after nine minutes when a solo run by Samuel Kalu saw his shot deflected in by South African defender Buhle Mkhwanazi. The hosts fought back and equalized through Lebo Mothiba, who finished off a pass from Percy Tau in the 26th minute. South Africa are in second place with nine points, while Libya who hammered Seychelles 8-1 in the group’s other match are with seven points. The group’s final set of matches will come up on March 22, with Nigeria hosting Seychelles who have one point, and Libya hosting South Africa.
