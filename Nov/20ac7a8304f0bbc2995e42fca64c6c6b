LAGOS – The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Edgal Imohimi, has charged police officers to ensure that the 2019 elections are violence-free. He said the duty of the police during the election is to make sure the citizens have a conducive environment to vote. He gave the charge at a workshop organized by a non-governmental organization, Boundless Hands Africa, in partnership with the Lagos State Police to train senior officers. The training with the theme: “Mitigating Election Violence, 2019 General Elections In Focus,” was held in Ikeja, Lagos. The commissioner said a lot is expected from the police in conduct of the 2019 elections and encouraged the senior police officers to study the 2015 Electoral Act as amended. “You must all know that our job is not just to protect electoral officials but also citizens, as well as electoral materials. “I also want the officers that are trained today to go back to their various offices and train their officers on what they have learnt. He further held that no officers must be found wanting after the training as he expected what they have learnt to reflect on them and their officers. One of the trainers, CSP Patrick Atairo, also admonished the officers on ‘core policing tasks”.
