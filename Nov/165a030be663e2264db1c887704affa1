LAGOS – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said that global passenger traffic for September rose to 5.5 per cent compared to the same month in 2017. The association however, said that this was a slowdown from the 6.4 per cent growth recorded in August year-over-year. It said that capacity climbed 5.8 per cent and load factor slipped for the first time in eight months, down 0.3 percentage point compared to the year-earlier period, to 81.4 per cent. IATA estimated that impacts from severe hurricane and typhoon activity in September shaved around 0.1-0.2 percentage point off expected growth. However, even after accounting for these impacts, monthly traffic demand was below the 6.7 per cent year-to-date pace. Mr. Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director-General stated that while September’s traffic growth was in line with the long-term average, it represented a moderation compared to recent months. This, he said, was likely owing to the anticipated reduced demand boost from lower airfares due to rising airline cost pressures, particularly fuel, adding that heightened uncertainty about trade policies and mounting protectionist policies may also be having an impact. International passengers climbed 4.9 per cent with airlines in all regions recording growth compared to 2017. Total capacity climbed 5.1 per cent, and load factor dipped 0.1 percentage point to 81.2 per cent. African airlines posted a 6 per cent rise in passengers in September, down from 6.8 per cent in August. Capacity rose 4.9 per cent and load factor edged up 0.8 percentage point to 74.6 per cent. The healthy growth is taking place against an increasingly challenging economic backdrop for the region’s largest economies, South Africa and Nigeria. Asia-Pacific airlines’ traffic rose 5.4 per cent in September compared to the year-ago period. This was down from 7.4 per cent annual growth in August.
