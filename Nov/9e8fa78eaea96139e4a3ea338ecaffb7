Thierry Henry, Monaco boss has been assured of the “total support” of the club’s Russian billionaire owner after picking up the first win. After registering just a point from his first four Ligue 1 matches since replacing Leonardo Jardim in October, Henry saw Radamel Falcao score the only goal of the game at Caen on Saturday to give the 2016-17 French champions their first win since Aug. 11. “After a trip to Moscow during which he had several meetings and celebrated his birthday with those close to him and his friends on November 22, Dimitri Rybolovlev came to see AS Monaco’s training session,” a spokesperson said. “He took advantage of that to congratulate them for their win against Caen and assure them – as well as Thierry Henry – of his total support and to share with them his confidence in the ability of the team and the AS Monaco technical stuff to turn things round despite the current difficulties.” The result still left Monaco – who last season finished as runners-up to Paris Saint-Germain – second from bottom of the table, but they are now just two points from safety.
