A cross-party group of MPs has called for political parties to publish the number of women they put forward for election to end the “diversity deficit” in Parliament. Several senior politicians signed a letter urging the UK Government to enact Section 106 of the Equality Act (2010) that would ensure parties reported their gender gap among election candidates. The call comes in the week marking 100 years since women first gained the right to stand for election to the House of Commons. Since then, there have only been 491 female MPs – just 50 more than the number of men currently sitting in Parliament.Conservative MP Nicky Morgan, Shadow Equalities Minister Dawn Butler, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and SNP MP Hannah Bardell were among the politicians to add their name to the letter. Organisations and individuals including Dr Helen Pankhurst, Centenary Action Group, the Fawcett Society, Women’s Aid and the Electoral Reform Society have all campaigned for Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt to implement Section 106.
