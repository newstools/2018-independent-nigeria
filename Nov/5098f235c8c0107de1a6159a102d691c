The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), is set to hold a dialogue to develop the automobile sector and proffer solutions to myriads of problems plaguing the sector. According to LCCI, the theme of the dialogue is “Developing the Nigeria Auto Industry across the Entire Value Chain.” The dialogue is scheduled to take place on Friday November 23, 2018 by 10am at Commerce House, Victoria Island, Lagos. The programme will also feature a panel discussion and audience participation to allow for a balanced expert assessment, evaluation and intervention. Muda Yusuf, Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) said: “This dialogue session offers a good opportunity to revisit the auto policy and examine the upsides and downsides. Participants will also deliberate on workable solutions to increase the production and use of new vehicles, the need for structured intervention -from the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and the government. Stakeholders will also propose solutions that will include a more robust, but realistic policy; more transparent implementation; incentives for compliance; and disincentives for non-compliance.”
