The Chairman, Governing Board of Nigeria’s Digital Bridge Institute (DBI), Mr Titi Omo-Ettu, yesterday urged Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to invest in Information Communication Technology (ICT) skills to stimulate growth and boost GDP in the country. The Chairman, Governing Board of DBI, Mr Titi Omo-Ettu, who made the call at the institution’s one-day interactive forum with Directors of Human Resources and Information Technology (IT) of various government agencies in Abuja, said such investment will also help Nigeria catch up with the rest of the world in the area of digitisation, job creation, technology adaptation and deployment in the workplace. The interaction focused on the role of ICT in human resources with reference to capacity building development. He said: “It is my hope that as leaders in your various organisations, you will make the right decisions by recognising the need to give ICT training its deserved priority. “We must invest consciously in digital skills acquisition through training and retraining not only to remain relevant but to prepare the workforce for the unfolding digital revolution” Omo-Ettu emphasised that embracing emerging technologies was crucial in positioning government agency to remain relevant and more efficient. According to him, the digital age is altering how we do things socially, economically and politically, so the fast pace of changes in technology, tools and platforms in the ICT sector have necessitated need for continuous investments in training. He bemoaned how increased pace of globalisation and technological advancement was expanding the divide between Africa and other regions. Omo-Ettu, who gave a snapshot of how jobs and skills would differ in the digital era, said that government services would soon become more digitised.
