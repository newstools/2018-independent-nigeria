ABUJA – A German organisation, Green Innovation Centres for the Agriculture and Food Sector Programme (GIAE) Nigeria with the assistance of German Government via the Deutshe Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) has earmarked additional 3.5m euros for the training of small holder farmers in Nigeria in the production of rice, maize, cassava and Irish potatoes. Speaking at the end of a two-day stakeholders’ meeting on maize value chain in Abuja at the weekend, Ms. Caroline Trimborn, Project Coordinator of GIAE, explained that the fund would also be used to build the capacity of some selected financial institutions in the country aimed at helping them to develop financial products, which would in turn, support small holder farmers through agricultural financing. According to her, the project is expected to come on stream early next year, adding that 3.5m euros had been set aside for its implementation. According to her, “The fund is for another programme in agriculture financing in Nigeria. We will build the capacity of farmers and selected financial institutions. We want to train financial institutions to support small holder farmers in Nigeria. “We will train cooperatives, companies to help them develop financial products that will meet the needs of farmers and agro-processing companies.” It would be recalled that GIAE Nigeria has been implementing projects in the country in seven states; Benue, Nasarawa, Kaduna, Kano, Ogun, Oyo, and Plateau, which is designed to raise the income and productivity of small holder farmers.
