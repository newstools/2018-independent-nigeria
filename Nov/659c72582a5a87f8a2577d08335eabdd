LAGOS – Sweet Sensation Plc, one of the leading Fast Food outlets in Nigeria has been sued for copying Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) plan prepared for one of its outlets at Sobo-Akowonjo to cover for its Opebi, Ikeja outlet, without the consent and authority of the approved Food Safety Management. The claimant, James Marsh and Associates, has therefore demanded for the sum of N100miliion as damages for breach of the plaintiff’s copyright in the case filed at the Federal High Court, Lagos. It was alleged that after copying the claimant’s work for its Ketu outlet, the defendant, Sweet Sensation, then included the claimant’s name on the HACCP plan knowing fully well that the claimant was not the maker. Also stated in the paper work presented to the Federal High Court in Lagos, the infringing HACCP plan bearing the name of the claimant was not prepared by a professional and certainly not certified by the claimant. Consequently, in the event of an outbreak, the claimant’s reputation and goodwill would be destroyed having been presented as the ‘consultant’ for the infringing plan. The claimant avers that the defendant must have copied its work for all of its twenty one (21) other outlets. The claimant accordingly has reported the defendant to the special Anti-Fraud Unit of Nigerian Police Force at Ikoyi, Lagos by a petition dated August 13, 2018. In the petition sent to the office of the Inspector General of Police, through the commissioner of police of Police Fraud Unit, by the claimant and signed by the Managing Director/ CEO, James Olawole Marsh, stated that the management of Sweet Sensation Plc, connived against the claimant’s firm to forge their proprietary and confidential template tagged as ‘Trade Secret’. “They further inscribed the name of James Marsh and Associates on the forged documents presented to the government as our original handwork. They also conspired and appended their signatures on the forged documents,” the statement read.
