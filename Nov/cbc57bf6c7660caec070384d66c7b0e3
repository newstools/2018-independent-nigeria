Zimbabwe’s former President Robert Mugabe, 94, is unable to walk because of ill health, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has said. According to reports by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Mugabe has been in Singapore for treatment for an undisclosed illness for the past two months, he added. The former president also made several medical trips there towards the end of his time in power. Mnangagwa became head of state a year ago after Mugabe was ousted following the intervention of the army. Up to that point, Mugabe was the only president Zimbabwe had known, having been in power for 37 years. He led the movement for Zimbabwean independence from white minority rule. President Mnangagwa was addressing a rally in his predecessor’s home area when he talked about the former leader’s health. “He is now old. Of course, he now is unable to walk but whatever he asks for we will provide,” the AFP news agency quotes him as saying. When Mugabe was in power officials said he was being treated for eye problems, denying rumours that he had cancer. Despite being unable to walk, Mnangagwa said the former leader was feeling better and would be back in the country next week. “We are looking after him. He is the founding father of the nation of Zimbabwe. He is our founding father of free Zimbabwe,” the president added, AFP reports. The government is paying for Mugabe’s treatment. After taking over from him last year, Mnangagwa won a disputed presidential election in July.
