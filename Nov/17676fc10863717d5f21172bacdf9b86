Kenya is attending the International Trade Fair of Havana (Fihav 2018) where it is exhibiting excellent products, such as tea and coffee, to promote its sales in the Caribbean and Latin America, a diplomatic source said on Friday.  According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Kenya is currently the world’s largest exporter of black tea and its crops will continue to grow in the coming years. It also produces one of the best wet-processed soft Arabic coffees in the planet, according to reports from international tasters. In general, the coffee industry provides livelihood to about 700,000 households, employs one third of the agricultural workforce and is one of the main sources of foreign currency income, according to information from the Kenyan stand at Fihav 2018. For the second time, Kenya is present at Fihav and ‘we hope that in the future, we will bring more products and companies,’ said the official, who appreciated the contacts with Cuban authorities and companies interested in his country’s offers. In Muchiri’s opinion, the portfolio of opportunities for foreign investment, presented at the meeting, speaks in favor of Cuba’s efforts for development under difficult conditions, due to the economic, financial and commercial blockade imposed by the United States.
