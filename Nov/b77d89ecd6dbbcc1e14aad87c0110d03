LAGOS – Lagos State House of Assembly has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to prevail on the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) to stop the pursuit of alleged smugglers beyond the border areas of the state. It said this had led to loss of lives of innocent Lagosians. The call was sequel to a matter of urgent public importance raised by David Setonji (Badagry II), citing the NCS operation around Badagry roundabout on November 20, 2018, which led to the death of one Patience Oni, as the officers were pursuing rice smugglers. “It is very unfortunate that officers of the Nigerian Customs, while chasing rice smugglers, shot sporadically into the air and killed an innocent woman in my constituency. “I urge the House to prevail on the Nigerian Customs Service to stop this, it seems we are under siege,” he said. Rasheed Makinde (Ifako Ijaiye II), in his own contribution, reminded the House of such occurrence in his constituency a few months ago and urged the House to take more stringent measures to end the practice.
