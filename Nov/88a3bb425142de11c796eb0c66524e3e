A 33-year-old man,  Abolaji Abiodun, was on  Wednesday arraigned in an Ota Magistrates’ Court in Ogun for allegedly collecting N141,000 under false pretence to supply building materials to one Tunde Emmanuel. Abiodun, who lives at No. 12,  Ilo-Awera, Ota, is facing a charge of obtaining money under false pretence. The Prosecutor, Insp  Rosemary Samson, told the court that the accused committed the offence on Aug. 4 at Iyana-Iyesi, Ota.
