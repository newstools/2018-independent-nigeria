Lagos – Bafana Bafana coach, Stuart Baxter, is not losing sleep over Nigeria’s injury crisis ahead of this weekend crucial Nations Cup qualifier against the Super Eagles of Nigeria. He said that he won’t allow the crisis to derail his game plan for the match in Johannesburg. Injuries have ruled out goalkeeper Francis Uzoho and top goal scorer, Odion Ighalo as well as Ogenyi Onazi and out-of-form skipper, John Mikel Obi. Baxter, however, insisted that this would have little bearing on South Africa’s preparations. “Nigeria have got such depth that I don’t need to go into too much individual detail because if Ighalo doesn’t play they have (Kelechi) Iheanacho,” the coach said. “I will be more worried about what our players do. “Yes, we will have a game plan and we hope it will suit them badly. But if I follow up on what I said, that we respect Nigeria but don’t fear them, I don’t think I can fill my players with what the Nigerians can do to us. We have to know that, accept that and get on with the game.” The coach said that he does not want to have to rely on looking for all three points they would play Libya in their final group match in March next year, meaning he would be more than relieved to beat Super Eagles again. “Their injuries will affect it (how Bafana plan) a little bit, but we will work on our defending and making sure there are no gaps instead of focusing on the fact that Ighalo isn’t there. “We should track and release properly, don’t sleep or ball watch. If we do that then we have a chance – let them worry about their problems. We have our problems and we will manage them, we won’t start complaining and use that as an excuse.” Meanwhile, Bafana Bafana will be without influential midfielder, Dean Furman and the creativity of Kamohelo Mokotjo in the match.
