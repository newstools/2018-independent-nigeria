Lagos – Gbenga Ogunbote, Chief Coach of Rangers International of Enugu, has expressed disappointment over his team’s failure to win this year’s Super Cup on Tuesday. The Federation Cup champions lost 1-0 to Lobi Stars in the match played at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba on Tuesday, immediately after the international friendly match between the Super Eagles of Nigeria and the Cranes of Uganda which ended in a goalless draw. Samad Kabiru was the star of the day for the Makurdi side as he profited from a slip by Rangers defence line to blast home the only goal of the match on added time of the first half. “This was a good exhibition but we lost to a big mix up at the back. I am indeed disappointed by the result but we are going back to correct the noticed lapses. “This is only our second game since we won the Federation Cup and I think it contributed to this loss. “I am positive of a good outing in the CAF Confederation Cup which is our next game,” said Ogunbote after the encounter. Rangers International kick start its challenge for continental honors next week Wednesday, November 28, 2018 with a home game against Defense Force S.C of Ethiopia in the preliminary round of 2018 Total/CAF Confederation Cup with the return leg scheduled for the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, in a week time. Rangers have successfully acquired the services of former attacking sensation and Super Eagles’ FIFA World Cup star, Michael Uchebo, Bobby Clement, Ivorian star; Pascal Seka and many others to help it challenge for the top prizes in the three competitions it is featuring.
