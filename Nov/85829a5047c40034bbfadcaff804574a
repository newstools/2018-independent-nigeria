Godwin Izilien, former Nigeria Super Falcons coach, has called for the sack of current manager of the women national team, Thomas Dennerby. This follows Nigeria’s surprise 1-0 loss to South Africa in their opening match at the ongoing 2018 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations. A late strike from Thembi Kgatlana secured Banyana Banyana 1-0 win over the reigning and eight-time continental champions at the Cape Coast Stadium on Sunday. “It is not too late to fire this so-called foreign coach because he has just demonstrated that he knows nothing about African football,” Izilien said. “I watched the match, and started wondering if that was the same Super Falcons. I blame the NFF for wasting our money on a foreign coach. We don’t need an expatriate coach for the female team.” He added, “What our indigenous coaches lack is training and re-training. I am not against a male coach handling the female team, but it must be a Nigerian coach. “What Dennerby did with the team on Sunday was just trial and error. He didn’t do anything different from what our indigenous coaches have done in the past. “He had the materials, but no good coaching techniques. Till this moment, I am yet to understand why the NFF sacked Omagbemi and her coaching crew after they won the 2016 AWC title in Cameroon. This foreign coach has to go now.”
