Lagos – Benin Republic have set the right precedence in the fight against age cheating in sports after a court in that country sentenced 10 footballers and an official, former Benin Football Federation (FBF) president, Anjorin Moucharafou, to various jail terms. It will be recalled that earlier in the year, half of the country’s U-17 players for the 2019 Nations Cup qualifiers failed the mandatory Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) test, and were subsequently disqualified. The players were expelled from the tournament by CAF. They were subsequently arrested by local police upon their return to Cotonou where they were arraigned and sentenced each to one month in prison on Wednesday. Mathurin de Chacus, the newly elected FBF president, has promised to eradicate ‘corruption, improvisation and amateurism’ from the country’s football. His predecessor, Anjorin Moucharafou, who was briefly detained in 2011 following corruption scandals at the FBF, was sentenced to 12 months in jail and fined $400 at the same hearing with the 10 players. The current FBF secretary, Zéphirin Déguénon, the U-17 coach, Lafiou Yessoufou, and team doctor, Parfait Aivodji, were also fined $400 each. This is not the first time ‘age cheating scandal’ is making its way to the front page in the West African nation. Benin were suspended in 2004 by FIFA for the same practice and was disqualified from the U-17 Africa Cup of Nations in 2016 after some players failed the MRI test.
