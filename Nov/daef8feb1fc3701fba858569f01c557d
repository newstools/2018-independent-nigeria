BENIN – Coordinator, New HIV Vaccine and Microbicide Society (NHVMAS), Morenike Oluwatoyin Folayan yesterday stated that the body has concluded plans to collaborate with the Bioethics Society of Nigeria (BESON), to host the 2018 International Bioethics Forum with a good view of tackling the problem of vulnerability and exploitation in research. The NHVMAS boss, while addressing newsmen in Benin City in preparation for the event, said the theme for this year’s programme is “Bioethics, vulnerability and protection from exploitation in research”. She said the 2018 forum will bring together individuals and groups across many disciplines with interest in bioethics, including community activists, members of institutional review boards (IRB) and research ethics committees (RECs), researchers, and past and present participants in research, to explore the concepts of vulnerability and exploitation; share experiences from the field and proffer suggestions to how vulnerable individuals can be protected from exploitation during research.
