The resumption for the new season of the 2018-19 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season is no longer feasible after the authority of the league has now postponed the NPFL Kick off indefinitely. The postponement came from the backdrop of the Nigeria National League management inability to come up with promoted teams barely few days to earlier suggested kick off date of the elite league. The League Management Company (LMC) in a statement to club managers stated that the Congress which was to hold on Tuesday, November 27, in Asaba has been postponed indefinitely. Meanwhile, the club managers in the Bet9ja Nigeria National League (NNL) who are supposed to meet in Abuja next week are clamouring for eight teams to gain promotion to the NPFL as against the agreed four teams from NNL to NPFL. 2018/2019 NPFL season will soon get new date according to the official of the league.
