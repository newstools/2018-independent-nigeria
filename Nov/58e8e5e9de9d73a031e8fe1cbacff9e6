LAGOS – Christian Chukwu, former Super Eagles coach has warned against the return of Victor Moses to the Super Eagles saying it would be counter productive. Chukwu in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT on Tuesday was reacting against the backdrop of recent calls from some quarters that Moses was still very relevant to the national team by age and performance. Ahmed Musa, Super Eagles forward has said ahead of the international friendly between Nigeria and Uganda in Asaba, Delta State, “If he (Moses) wants to come back, the door is always open for him. For me I miss him very well.” Chukwu, however, disapproves the call noting that Moses decision should be respected to avert distractions in the team. “I don’t Support the call that Moses should return to the national team. “Moses decision should be respected; calling him back will create problem in the team, because anything wants, if he does not get it is an issue that will cause disaffection. “He should be allowed to enjoy his life, he knows what is good for him and his family – he should be allowed to go. Whatever vacuum his absence may have created can always be filled or replaced,” Chukwu said. Moses, 27, a Chelsea defender announced his retirement from international football in August after a six-year spell with the Super Eagles – making 37 appearances for Nigeria.
