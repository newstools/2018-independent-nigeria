Lagos – Onome Ebi, the Super Falcons skipper, has sounded confident ahead of today’s semifinal duel against the Indomitable Lioness of Cameroon in Accra. Nigeria finished second in Group B below South Africa while Cameroon topped Group A and the two sides will later today go head-to-head in what is obviously a rematch of the last edition where Desire Oparanozie’s first half strike was enough to hand Nigeria their tenth title. Speaking to thenff.com ahead of the match, Ebi said that the loss to South Africa was a wakeup call, noting that the defeat showed that they should not underrate any country in the championship. “We are in great spirit for the semifinal match with the Cameroonians. We made our mistake against South Africa, and I think it was a great wake-up call for us. That defeat told us something: that we should never under-rate any team and that we must be ready to give our 100 per cent for every match. “We will give everything we have to get past the Lionesses and qualify for the World Cup, and then we can battle the final with whichever team we meet there.” On the possibility of still qualifying for the World Cup even if they failed to beat Cameroon, the player said that they want to get the job of booking a place in France next year done today and not wanting to depend on the losers’ final for the ticket. “We are not interested in the losers’ route. We want to get to the final and to fight to retain our trophy. We want both the World Cup ticket and the AFCON trophy.”
