Lagos – The positive performance of the Nigerian equities market from the previous week can be viewed as a fluke as the benchmark index closed in the red last week. Despite increased buying activity in some bellwethers as investors sought to take advantage of attractive pricing, sell pressures dominated trading activities in the week. Accordingly, the All Share Index (ASI) depreciated 0.4 per cent week-on-week (W-o-W) to 32,058.28 points, while year-to-date (YTD) performance weakened to -16.2 per cent. In the same vein, market capitalisation reduced by N51.8 billion to N11.7 trillion while losses in Dangote Cement (-0.7%), Guaranty Trust Bank (-0.7%) and Zenith Bank (-1.6%) were the major drags to overall performance in the week. Trading activity level was mixed in the week as average volume traded expanded 19.1 per cent to 256.9 million units while average value traded reduced by 36.6 per cent to N2.3 billion. The top traded stocks by volume for the week were Diamond Bank (292.2m units), Ikeja Hotel (279.1m units) and FBN Holdings (106.5m units), while Guaranty Trust Bank (N1.8bn), Zenith Bank (N1.2bn) and Nestle Nigeria (N0.8bn) were the top traded stocks by value. Further analysis of market movement during the week showed a largely negative trend as the benchmark index declined on three of five trading days. The ASI started the week in the red on Monday, losing 0.2 per cent as investors sold off on banking stocks –Zenith Bank, Guaranty Trust Bank and Diamond Bank. However, there was some respite for the market on Tuesday with a marginal 0.03 per cent appreciation. The downtrend continued on Wednesday (-0.1%) and Thursday (-0.8%), but was reversed on Friday with a 0.6 per cent gain. Sector performance was mixed albeit skewed towards the red as three of five indices under our coverage declined W-o-W. The Oil & Gas index depreciated the most, down 1.1 per cent W-o-W due to losses in Seplat Petroleum Development Company (-2.4%) and Total Nigeria (-0.5%). The Banking and Insurance indices followed, losing 0.8 per cent and 0.5 per cent W-o-W respectively as sell pressures on Zenith Bank (-1.6%), Guaranty Trust Bank (-0.6%) and Linkage Assurance (-8.8%) dragged performance. On the flipside, the Industrial Goods index was the only gainer; rising 1.0 per cent as price appreciation in Lafarge WAPCO (+6.7%) buoyed the index, while the Consumer Goods index closed flat.
