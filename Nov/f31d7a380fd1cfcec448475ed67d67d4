President Muhammadu Buhari appears to have taken a U-turn over his stand on restructuring of Nigeria, admitting that there is a need for it. In his recent moves, the president tacitly agreed that Nigeria needed to review its structure. It will be recalled that the call for restructuring is the major campaign manifesto for Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. To make this achievable, the president during an interactive session with Nigerians based in France highlighted some conditions that should be considered. His words: “There are too many people talking lazily about restructuring in Nigeria. Unfortunately, people are not asking them individually what do they mean by restructuring? What form do they want restructuring to take? “Do they want us to have something like the three regions we used to have? And now we have 36 states and the FCT. What form do they want? They are just talking loosely about restructuring. “Let them define it and then we see how we can peacefully do it in the interest of Nigerians. “They are just saying they want Nigeria restructured and they don’t have the clue of what form the restructuring should be. So, anybody who talks to you about restructuring in Nigeria, ask him what he means and the form he wants it to take.”
