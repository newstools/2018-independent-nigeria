The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have prepared soup and bread for young people who have been helped by the homelessness charity Centrepoint. William and Kate were visiting the charityâ€™s centre in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, when they were asked to help prepare lunch before serving food to two of the young people who have been helped in the town.The couple looked relaxed as they chatted with staff and young people, with the duke joking that it was far from a normal lunch as he gestured to the photographers and reporters ranged in front of him. Kate arrived with William in a blue Eponine dress after the couple had opened a new McLaren car parts factory in nearby Rotherham.
