Changchun Yatai of China striker, Odion Jude Ighalo, and John Mikel Obi, the Super Eagles and Tiajin Teda captain, face fresh challenges in China, which could see them quit the Chinese Super League during the transfer window. Ighalo might be strongly considering his future with Yatai following their relegation last season, while Mikel has been bogged by series of injuries that put his future in doubt at Tianjin. Apart from these, Ighalo and Mikel may certainly be encouraged to act fast and move on, as clubs in the Chinese Super League (CSL) will be required to adhere to a new set of regulations from next season, including a player salary cap, restrictions on cash injections for clubs, as well as player bonuses, transfer fees and salaries. The new rules require clubs to confide to a unified accounting and player contract standards, while the salary cap will set limits on the amount of earnings they can spend on player remuneration. Starting in the 2019 season, every domestic player must sign labour contracts and single-game bonus limits will be introduced, with the amounts announced at the start of each season. Cash payments and similar types of awards will be highly restricted. This new reform in the Chinese Super League might just be an act of rejection method of foreign players from the Chinese settings.
