Segun Olaniyan Katsina – Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State on Monday charged the Nigeria Armed Forces to be above board in the discharge of their duty by shunning “primordial sentiments”. Masari gave the charge when he received members of Course 41 team on a study tour of the state led by Brigadier-General O R Aiyenigba at the Government House in Katsina. According to him, “The service you provide is the highest any person can provide for his mother land. “We, as politicians, we will appreciate you more than you think and we look up to you for a much more united group that the country can depend upon”. The governor, who urged them to work hard to safeguard the Nigerian territory, noted that, politicians would always play politics. “Some of us play it in the overall interest, but as human beings, some of us play whatever form of politics in order to achieve power. “Am sure your training is such that, it is above primordial sentiments of where I come from, what is my tribe, my geographical location and religion,” he stated. He added, “With your oath of office, you are trained and your discipline should be above these sentiments”, urging them to continue to protect the sovereignty and integrity of the country. While condoling the team for the loss of it’s soldiers in Borno State recently, Masari prayed God to continue to strengthen and protect them in the discharge of their duty to their mother land. Aiyenigba informed the governor that, the Course 41 students were in state on a study tour to carry out a research work on the “Nigeria Educational System and National Development”, a case study of Katsina State.
