A 25-year-old man, Nsikan Israel, who allegedly stole N30,000 from one Miss Angel Peter, was on Tuesday brought before a Badagry Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State. Israel, of no fixed address, is facing a three-count charge of stealing, assault and breach of public peace. The Prosecutor, ASP Akpan Ikem, told the court that the accused committed the offences on October 1, at Yemirite Hotel, Ajara, in Badagry. “The accused assaulted the complainant by beating her up without any reasonable cause. “The accused, in the process, stole N30,000 cash from the complainant. “He also conducted himself in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by unlawfully instigating members of the public against the complainant,” Ikem said. According to the prosecutor, the offences contravene Sections 285,168 and 166 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Chief Magistrate, Lazarus Hotepo, granted the accused N50,000 bail, with one surety in like sum, and adjourned the case until December 10, for hearing.
