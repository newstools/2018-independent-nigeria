Lagos – Contrary to analysts’ expectations that the nation’s headline inflation will remain on the rise until the end of the 2019 election, the October 2018 inflation rate slowed to 11.26 percent from 11.28 percent recorded in September, 2018. The October 2018 number, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), was 2 basis points lower than the rate recorded in September, 2018. Analysts at FSDH Merchant Bank, United Capital, and FDC had earlier projected 11.34 percent and 11.35 percent inflation rates respectively for October, citing continued impact of rising food prices. On month-on-month basis, the headline index increased by 0.74 percent in October 2018, down by 0.09 percent points from the rate recorded in September 2018 (0.83) percent. The percentage change in the average composite CPI for the twelve months period ending October 2018 over the average of the CPI for the previous twelve months period was 12.78 percent, from 13.16 percent recorded in September 2018. The urban inflation rate increased by 11.64 percent (year-on-year) in October 2018 from 11.70 percent recorded in September 2018, while the rural inflation rate increased by 10.93 percent in October 2018 from 10.92 percent in September 2018. On a month-on-month basis, the urban index rose by 0.76 percent in October 2018, from 0.86 percent recorded in September, while the rural index also rose by 0.72 percent in October 2018, down from the rate recorded in September 2018 (0.82) percent. The food sub-index increased on month-on-month basis by 0.82 percent in October 2018 from 1.00 percent recorded in September. The average annual rate of change of the food sub-index for the twelve-month period ending October 2018 over the previous twelve-month average was 15.36 percent, from the average annual rate of change recorded in September (15.92) per cent,” the NBS stated. According to the NBS, in October 2018, food inflation on a year on year basis was highest in Bayelsa (16.36%), Abuja (15.85%) and Taraba (15.27%), while Bauchi (12.17%), Oyo (11.76%) and Plateau (11.36%) recorded the slowest rise in food inflation. On month on month basis, however, October 2018 food inflation was highest in Kogi (2.28%), Plateau (2.42%) and Nasarawa (2.17%), while Akwa Ibom, Benue, Kwara and Ondo all recorded food price deflation or negative inflation (general decrease in the general price level of goods and services or a negative inflation rate) in October 2018. The percentage change in the average composite CPI for the twelve months period ending October 2018 over the average of the CPI for the previous twelve months period was 12.78 percent, from 13.16 percent recorded in September 2018. The urban inflation rate increased by 11.64 percent (year-on-year) in October 2018 from 11.70 percent recorded in September 2018, while the rural inflation rate increased by 10.93 percent in October 2018 from 10.92 percent in September 2018. On a month-on-month basis, the urban index rose by 0.76 percent in October 2018, from 0.86 percent recorded in September, while the rural index also rose by 0.72 percent in October 2018, down from the rate recorded in September 2018 (0.82) percent. Looking ahead, analysts at United Capital said they expect the food inflation sub-index to rise marginally as the anticipated increase in the supply of food product is expected to be offset by increased demand. “On the supply side, the declining incidence of farmer-herder crisis and farmland flooding is positive for supply, especially as we approach the peak harvest season. However, demand is expected to increase as we approach the festive period. Thus, we expect month-on-month food inflation to rise slightly by 0.84 per cent in November 2018. “Elsewhere, campaign-related spending recorded during November 2018, may pressure the core inflation sub-index higher to 0.85 per cent in November 2018. On a balance of these factors, we expect headline inflation to inch higher, rising to 11.32 per cent in November 2018,” analysts at United Capital stated.
