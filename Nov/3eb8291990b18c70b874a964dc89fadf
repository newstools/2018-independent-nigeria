ADO-EKITI – Some concerned Civil Society Groups (CSOs) have urged President Muhammadu Buhari to live up to the expectations in  the agreement reached with the Swiss  Bank on the sharing of recovered asset of $321 million linked to the late Gen. Sani Abacha military junta. The New Initiative for Social Development (NISD) and Africa Network for Economic and Environmental Justice (ANEEJ) had been partnering with the Department for International Development (DFID) to track the distribution. Mr. Abiodun Oyebode, the NISD Executive Director, disclosed that the groups would monitor how the cash transfer programme to poor Nigerians in the Southwest states of Ekiti, Oyo and Osun would be prosecuted. Oyeleye revealed that in compliance with the agreement reached with the Swiss government that the money would be used to cater for the poor, which he said facilitated the release of the funds. He said the three states were listed in the region to benefit in the first tranch of the scheme. He said the monitoring mechanism became expedient to ensure that only the poor Nigerians would be captured in the data already prepared by the World Bank and not those that had alliances with politicians and political parties. The NISD boss added that ANEEJ had been monitoring of received assets in Nigeria through Transparency and Accountability projected tagged MANTRA , with the support of the British Department for International Development(DFID). He said the Swiss and British governments had released a sum of $394 million looted funds to Nigeria recently under the guise that the monies would be used to cater for poor Nigerians. He said that proper monitoring by apolitical bodies like his organisation would ensure strict compliance to agreements. Oyeleye said: “The essence of the MANTRA programme to be undertaken by ANEEJ and NISD was to ensure that the cash transfer got to the direct beneficiaries in Ekiti, Osun and Oyo states in Southwest.
