Lagos – Gernort Rohr, the Super Eagles coach, is mulling a three-week camping for the former African champions ahead of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations taking place in Cameroon in June. The coach, while responding to questions on his plans for the Cup of Nations, noted that such camping spanning three weeks or more would enable him pick the right players for each position, even as he admitted that it would also enable him have the right balance in the team. The Franco-German coach admitted that Nigeria is blessed with many good players, noting that the coaches must find the right balance for the team ahead of the Cup of Nations. “We may have a three-week camping before we travel for the Cup of Nations but we are still looking at the possibility and other considerations with the NFF, who have been very supportive, to make sure that Nigeria do well. “We must find the right balance in this team before the Africa Cup of Nations and also ensure that the right players are picked to represent Nigeria,” he was quoted as saying. Nigeria has not participated in the biannual competition since winning the cup in South Africa in 2013 with the late Stephen Keshi as the coach. The Super Eagles qualified for the 2019 edition after drawing with South Africa 1-1 in Johannesburg even with the last qualifying match against Seychelles yet to be played. Meanwhile, Rohr, while speaking on a cable television sports programme, said that the team would likely camp in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, revealing that Uyo would solve many issues of logistics and acclimatisation since it is close to Cameroon’s border. That has now informed the Franco-German tactician’s decision to suggest Uyo as base camp for the AFCON programme, which he said will be set in motion with the match against Seychelles and an international friendly in the same month.
