National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has reacted to reports that he would secretly work with the presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar to defeat President Muhammadu Buhari ahead of the 2019 presidential elections. Tinubu once again reaffirmed his full support for President Buhari and his re-election ambition in next year’s general elections. It would be recalled that in a recent interview, a member of the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT) and former FCT Minister Abba Gana, had claimed that Tinubu would work for Atiku to defeat Buhari because of his long-standing relationship with the former Vice President. However, in statement through his Media Adviser, Tunde Rahman, Tinubu denied Gana’s claims, insisting that he remains solidly behind Buhari and would work for his re-election. The statement read in part: “His Excellency Asiwaju Bola Tinubu indicated long ago where he stood on the matter of the 2019 election. “He has continued to say he remains firmly behind that patriot, President Muhammadu Buhari, in his mission to rebuild the country from the ruins of the PDP years. “Only two days ago, he restated this position while speaking with correspondents at the State House in Abuja. “He said the PDP could hold their meetings anywhere they liked and that Nigerians know who means well for them and is trustworthy. “Where the former FCT Minister, Abba Gana got his conviction that Asiwaju Tinubu would do otherwise is left only to himself. “Yes, His Excellency Asiwaju has had a relationship with former Vice President, His Excellency Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, just like he has had with many of other leaders in his political journey. “But this is about Nigeria, the well-being of the country and of Nigerians. On this score, he has made his pick.”
