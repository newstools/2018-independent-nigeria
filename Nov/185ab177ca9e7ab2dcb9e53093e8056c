In a day Manchester United were booed off Old Trafford following their goalless game against Crystal Palace, supporters of both Manchester City and Liverpool were in cloud nine as their teams recorded handsome wins in the league. While Manchester City beat West Ham 4-0 away, 10 man Liverpool beat Watford away 3-0. However as Manchester United wobbling continue, they suffered more frustration as they were held to a goalless draw by a spirited Crystal Palace â€“ the sixth time United have failed to win in nine Old Trafford games this season. Romelu Lukaku had an attempt ruled out for offside, while Wayne Hennessey produced smart saves to keep out Jesse Lingard and, in the closing stages, Lukaku. But Palace, without a win in their previous seven league games and just above the relegation zone, created several chances to secure a first league win at the venue since 1989. Patrick van Aanholt twice went close, Andros Townsend blazed wide while a header by Cheikhou Kouyate was also disallowed for offside. Claudio Ranieri celebrated a winning return to the Premier League as he helped his new Fulham team to move off the foot of the table with a thrilling 3-2 victory over Southampton at Craven Cottage on Saturday. The Italian manager replaced Slavisa Jokanovic during the international break and weaved his magic straight away as he helped Fulham to end a losing run of seven consecutive defeats and secure their first Premier League victory since August.
