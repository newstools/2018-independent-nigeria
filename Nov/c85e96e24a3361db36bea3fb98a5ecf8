Percy Tau, the Bafana Bafana of South Africa forward, impressed Coach Gernot Rohr of the Super Eagles, and the German tactician says he hopes to see the player in a big club in Europe. Former Mamelodi Sundowns forward, Tau, drew praise from Rohr after his man-of-the-match performance in South Africa’s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against the Super Eagles at FNB Stadium on Saturday. The diminutive player set up the hosts’ equaliser, which was finished off by Lebo Mothiba, and caused all sorts of problems for the visiting team throughout the contest. In the end, the match ended 1-1, a result that saw the Super Eagles book a place for the 2019 event, with Bafana Bafana needing to avoid defeat in their final qualifying match against Libya in Sfax in March next year to qualify. Speaking after the match, Rohr heaped praise on Brighton and Hove Albion player – currently on loan at Union St Gilloise in Belgium’s second division – as well as few of his Bafana teammates. “Congratulations to this player Percy Tau. I hope to see him in a big team in Europe, in England or the championship. He is a really good player,” the German tactician told the media. “You have a wonderful player in Percy. You have a very good goalkeeper (Itumeleng Khune). “The captain (Thulani Hlatshwayo) is a good player. It’s a good team to go to AFCON, but it will not be easy in the last match. But I can give your coach advice for that match if he wants.” Rohr was, however, taken aback by the poor attendance at the 90 000-seater venue, saying he expected more people to turn up for a match of such magnitude. “I was surprised that the stadium was empty. You have such a game, and the stadium is empty. I don’t understand how, especially in this kind of game. If we had this game in Nigeria, we would have a lot of people,” he said.
