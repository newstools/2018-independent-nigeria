Thomas Meunier says Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will cope without Neymar and Kylian Mbappe against Liverpool if they have to. The pair both picked up injuries during the international break and sat out PSG’s 1-0 victory over Toulouse on Saturday – their 14th in a row in Ligue 1. Neymar has a groin problem while Mbappe’s injury is to his shoulder. Manager Thomas Tuchel expected both to return to training on Monday afternoon although whether they will be match-fit for Wednesday’s crunch clash in Champions League Group C remains to be seen. However, Meunier, who could be pushed into a more attacking role on the right if Mbappe is ruled out, says the squad is good enough to cope. He said: “From what I have heard, they are going to be back with the squad at the start of the week. It augurs well for Wednesday. In any case we have a squad that is pretty rich in terms of quality, and we will do our best with or without them.” Defeat for PSG would see them eliminated from the competition if Napoli, who entertain Red Star Belgrade, win, while a draw for PSG could also leave qualification out of their hands heading into matchday six.
