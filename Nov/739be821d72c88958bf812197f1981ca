Former Super Eagles’ chief coach Christian Chukwu on Tuesday said midfielder Mikel Obi’s absence from the upcoming Nigeria/South Africa clash would not affect the team negatively. Chukwu told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that Mikel’s absence from the home and away fixture against Libya did not affect the Super Eagles, and now would not be different Super Eagles will play Bafana Bafana on November 17 in Johannesburg in a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier. The former Green Eagles captain said that the Super Eagles were capable of beating Bafana Bafana with good focus and team spirit. “We should remember that Mikel was not in the match against Libya and yet Nigeria came out victorious. “So, his absence in the South Africa match may not have any negative impact on the team,’’ he said. Chukwu told NAN that only the coach could specifically say why Mikel was not listed in the squad. He said Coach Gernot Rohr was firmly in charge of the Super Eagles and should be allowed to work with the list of players he wants. South Africa had beaten Nigeria 2-0 in Uyo on June 10, 2017 in their opening game of the qualifiers.
