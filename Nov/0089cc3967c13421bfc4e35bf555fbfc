Lagos – Coach Gernot Rohr has revealed that he planned to qualify Nigeria for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in their next match against South Africa in Johannesburg on November 17. Nigeria lead Group E of the qualifiers with nine points after Super Eagles’ three-match win over Seychelles and Libya, while South Africa are second on the group with eight points even as Libya and Seychelles, with four and no point, are third and last in the group respectively. A draw for Nigeria will take their point haul to 10 and that will automatically qualify the three-time African champions for the Nations Cup billed to take place in Cameroon next year. Rohr, who is still without the service of his captain, John Obi Mikel, since after the World Cup in Russia, said that he wanted his boys to repeat the performance of World Cup qualifiers, where the team qualified with a game in hand. “We want to qualify from this group if possible in the next game against South Africa in Johannesburg which means we will do the same thing that we did for the qualification for the 2018 World Cup held in Russia. “If we have a point in South Africa we have qualified even if Libya win in Seychelles and also win at home against South Africa, Libya will get 10 points. With our 10 points, we will still qualify for 2019 AFCON. But our ambition and resolve is to win in South Africa but a draw would be enough,” Rohr assured.
