Lagos – Super Eagles skipper and Tianjin Teda of China midfielder, John Mikel Obi has received strong words of encouragement from coach Gernot Rohr to carry on with the Nigerian national team unless otherwise decide. The former Bayern Munich defender in a sports programme monitored in Lagos, urged Mikel to be part of the Africa Cup of Nations squad, and probably call it quit after lifting the trophy next year in Cameroon. “We know that fitness and injuries are the big issues Mikel is facing, but we want to encourage him to try and make it to the Nations Cup in Cameroon, then bow out by winning the trophy. “It all depends on how he can keep his fitness, his commitment and psychology. “We can try as much as we can, we can help him run a soft programme, but it all depends mostly on him” “He is the only one that can decide whether to be part of the team to the Nations Cup in Cameroon or not. On our part, we will continue to encourage and support him to be in the team because we still believe in him and in his experience”, Rohr said. The Franco-German soccer tactician admitted that Mikel has found the going tough for both club and country in recent months due to injury issues and should not be abandon now. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that the Injury sustained by Mikel was while he was on national duty with the Super Eagles at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. In the second group game fixture against Iceland, Mikel picked up the wrist injury as the Super Eagles picked up their only win of the World Cup but still played with it in the last group game against Argentina. Mikel has since gone ahead to miss the Nations Cup qualifier against Seychelles in September and the next two qualifiers against Libya and the Bafana Bafana of South Africa.
