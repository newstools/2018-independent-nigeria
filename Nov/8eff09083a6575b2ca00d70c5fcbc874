LAGOS – Still basking in the euphoria of Nigeria’s return to the Africa Cup of Nations after missing the last two editions, some stakeholders in Nigerian football have called on the NFF and the Coach Gernot Rohr-led technical crew of the Super Eagles to begin earnest preparation for the competition proper billed for Cameroon. To the stakeholders, who spoke to DAILY INDEPENDENT during a separate chat, it was imperative that the coach and the football house come together to draw up a comprehensive plan of action towards ensuring that Nigeria makes a mark next year after a long absence from the premier continental football competition. Adegboye Onigbinde, who has severally linked Nigeria’s poor performance to the absence of clear-cut plans of action, said that the euphoria and the noise over the qualification should not drown the need for adequate preparation. “It is good that they qualify quite early. It has given us the chance to plan ahead and I want to say that the technical crew should start plans immediately if we must get it right before the competition starts proper.” Segun Odegbami noted that this is the time to end the celebration and start preparing for the competition. The Africa Cup of Nations winner said that the NFF should call for a comprehensive plan from the coaches. “I expect them to know that the real job has just begun because we have gone beyond the level of mere participation. NFF should demand a comprehensive plan of action from the coaches and if we get it right now, certainly we can challenge for the cup next year,” he said. Meanwhile, Ike Shorunmu, the team’s former goalkeeper, said the last qualifying match against Seychelles should serve as a platform to boosting the team through testing some of the hitherto untested talents. “From the next match against Seychelles, I want the coaches to starting looking at some of the good players we have not used before. Our preparation for the competition should start with that match,” he said.
