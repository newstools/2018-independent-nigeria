YENAGOA – Local vendors in the Niger Delta region have expressed interest in the $7billion gas production expansion project of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Limited christened NLNG Train-7 in Bonny Island, Rivers State. To this end, the vendors, under the aegis of Association of Niger Delta Vendors in Oil and Gas, would be participating in a proposed business roundtable on the project slated for November 22-23, 2018 for young entrepreneurs in the oil and gas sector in Bonny Kingdom. Already, the local organising committee had commenced an awareness interactive session as part of preparations for the summit, and an online portal had been established for bookings and enquiries. Chris Jumbo, the organising committee chairman for the event, said the workshop was strategic in several ways as it would also address some of the associated challenges ahead of the take-off of the NLNG Train-7 project. He stated that more than 100 indigenous vendors and many business groups had signed up for the workshop. He noted that engaging vendors from the locality would encourage the people to support the expansion project and explore inherent business opportunities while ensuring a safe environment for business. Jumbo said: “We want to applaud the organisers of this novel initiative. It encourages community participation, and when that is factored in, the environment becomes conducive. “Leadership of various professional groups in Bonny Kingdom are favourably disposed to the idea of this gathering to examine the potential of the proposed NLNG Train-7.
