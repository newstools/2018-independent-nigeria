LAGOS – Home is where a person’s story typically begins, and for budding playwright and actor, Genoveva Umeh, she is ready to share that story with the world at Lagos Fringe come next weekend from Friday, November 16 to Sunday, November 18 at Freedom Park, Lagos. Being her debut work as a playwright, ‘Home’ is directed by the multi-talented Ibukun Fasunhan, who has stage managed notable productions like ‘Wakaa the Musical’, ‘Heartbeat the Musical’, ‘Rubiewe’, ‘Fela Arrest the Music’, ‘Death and the King’s Horseman’, ‘Saro the Musical’, amongst others; coupled with directing credits like  ‘Maybe Tomorrow and ‘Many Colours Make the Thunder-King’. He also served as associate producer of the British Council Lagos Theatre Festival from 2016 to 2018. ‘Home’, as written by Umeh, shares a funny and honest realisation of the pressures of being a young Nigerian in the Diaspora. In this coming of age play, she is set to take the audience on a journey that navigates memories and current experiences in trying to find home. As an actor, Umeh has several stage achievements like Mind body Soul (2016) and Dodo (2018). Her film background consists of two television series namely, Origin (2016) and Jenifa’s Diary (season 7). ‘Home’, a one-woman play, according to Umeh, is a real treat for the Nigerian audience because the life of a first-generation immigrant’s child is something we don’t see often in theatre. Umeh further commended the director, Ibukun Fasunhan for his keen ear to her uncomfortable stories and turning them to beautiful piece of theatre that embody the purpose of Home. Inspired by her personal experience as a young Nigerian born in Nigeria and then migrating with her parents to United Kingdom, she shares a funny, yet honest experience of a girl living a lower class lifestyle in a largely considered affluent London.
