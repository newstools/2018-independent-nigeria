Lagos – Super Eagles technical adviser, Gernot Rohr, has expressed excitement with the current forms of Kenneth Omeruo and Samuel Chukwueze in the La Liga. Both players are in Rohr’s list that will play South Africa next weekend, ahead of which the tactician is happy seeing both stars excel with their clubs last weekend. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that Omeruo held his own for 90 minutes with Leganes against Atletico Madrid, while Chukwueze continues waxing strong with Villarreal. Rohr said he expects Omeruo to push more for a starting place in the Super Eagles, after the stopper put up a yeoman’s show in a 1-1 draw against Atletico at the weekend. While Omeruo played all 90 minutes for the home team in his fourth straight start for Leganes, Chukwueze got his La Liga debut and was rated Villarreal’s best player in a 1-1 draw against Levante. Chukwueze, who also played the duration against Moses Simon’s team, has been invited by Rohr for the first time since representing Nigeria at U-17 and U-20 levels, but he is already getting plaudits from the coach. “Chukwueze has a good left foot, is quick, and can deliver and score. We need a player like him to give us balance in attack and he can also play through the middle.” On Omeruo, Rohr said: “I was really impressed with his performance, playing against a team like Atletico Madrid. “He was able to stay focused and consistent, that shows his great quality as a defender. “His performance is good for the Super Eagles as well as his club. We hope he continues in that manner. He will give a stiffer competition in the Super Eagles”, he said.
