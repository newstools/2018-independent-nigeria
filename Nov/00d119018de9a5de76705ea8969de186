British Prime Minister Theresa May got a reprieve in one of her Brexit battles Tuesday as party rebels said they did not yet have the strength for a leadership challenge. But she faced a new headache as parliamentary allies warned they could remove support from May’s minority government if she does not alter her divorce deal with the European Union. Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party struck a deal last year to back May’s Conservatives on major legislation. But the Protestant, pro-U.K. party opposes the Brexit deal’s plans for keeping the border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland open after Brexit, saying it weakens the ties binding the U.K. by creating separate trade rules for Northern Ireland. In a warning to May, DUP lawmakers abstained or opposed the government during several votes on finance bill late Monday,according to Daily mail. DUP lawmaker Sammy Wilson said the votes were “designed to send a political message to the government: Look, we’ve got an agreement with you but you’ve got to keep your side of the bargain.” May defended her deal in an article for Tuesday’s Belfast Telegraph, saying it “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future.” She said businesses would benefit because Northern Ireland would “be a gateway to both the EU market and the rest of the U.K.’s market.”
