Manchester United are said to be in the process of offering Marcus Rashford a double- your-money deal amid growing interest from Real Madrid. European champions Madrid are said to be eyeing up an end-of-season move for the England international, along with Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Christian Eriksen. According to the Daily Star, news of a potential bid from Real has forced United to speed up contract talks with Rashford, who currently earns £75,000 a week at Old Trafford. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is said to have taken charge of the discussions and he is willing to increase the academy product’s wages to £150,000 a week, on top of bonuses.
