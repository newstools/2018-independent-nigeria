In recognition of his strides towards youth empowerment and his robust representation as a lawmaker in the upper chamber of the legislative arm, Senator Dino Melaye, chairman, Senate Committee on Federal Capital Territory, will on December 7 receive the Nigeria’s Most Outstanding Senator of the Year Award from Icon & Legend Magazine. His investiture will be the high point of activities of the National Roundtable on Youth Empowerment Programme scheduled to hold at the Nigeria National Merit Award Merit House, Maitama, Abuja. The roundtable, according to the Chief Executive Officer, Icon & Legend Magazine, Mr Omosehin Akinduro, is aimed at empowering unemployed youths across the country with the direction for self-empowerment. A statement issued by the media company and its advisory board, under the chairmanship of the legal icon and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Professor Amuda-Kannike Abiodun, observed: “Senator Melaye has, for some people, become an enigma of sorts; and it is the nature and definition of an enigma to be misunderstood. But being misunderstood is different from being ineffective.” “Senator Melaye,” the statement continued, “was selected for the honour as a reward for his courage, forthrightness and unwavering determination, against all odds, to remain focused to his mandate of delivering quality representation for his people in the Senate.” Confirming the acceptance of his selection for the award, Melaye, through a letter dated October 24, 2018 and signed by his secretary, Cynthia Odele, said: “The senator accepts the award and appreciates the media company for the honour, believing that same will spur him to do more for humanity and the nation at large.” The event, to be hosted by Abiodun, will attract a team of speakers, with Professor (Reverend) Greg Erhabor, a renowned professor of medicine and consultant chest physician at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife, leading the pack.
