LAGOS – The Nigerian Association of Petroleum Explorationists (NAPE), yesterday gave a recipe on how best the Federal Government can diversify the nation’s economy that would add value to the lives of Nigerians. Dr. Andrew Ejayeriese, the President of the association said government’s diversification plan must include finding and enhancing new opportunities and prudently allocating its revenue which comes mainly from oil and gas to the development of other key sectors of the economy. Ejayeriese, who spoke at a press conference in Lagos ahead of the association’s conference and exhibition in Lagos next week, said although significant achievements have been recorded in the management of Nigeria’s oil and gas resources compared to recent past, government must strive that to build a more diversified and more resilient economy. According to him, government must offer oil and gas investors an attractive environment by reforming the regulatory, fiscal and licensing systems in the country. He said: ’’Knowing that the sustainability of the industry will be affected by a number of drivers including price of oil, impact of renewable and alternative energy sources, emergence of new competition and legislative frameworks, oil and gas companies will need to look beyond new discoveries, and pursue improved efficiencies and operational excellence and innovation’’ Ehayeriese also told journalists the need for the Federal Government to partner NAPE in the conduct of credible and transparent oil bid round with a view to attracting more investors and growing the oil and gas industry. The NAPE’s helmsman also advocated the need for the government to purge itself of political and other subterranean considerations in the conduct of oil bid round, saying the development would go a long way in generating more revenues for the government as well as creating more job opportunities for the country. To him, “Nigeria needs urgent review of archaic laws that tends to drawback the nation’s oil and gas industry”, adding that NAPE would continually mount advocacy on repeal of those law in order to conduct the affairs of the industry in line with global standards.
