University of Agriculture, Makurdi (UAM Tillers) won the maiden Higher Institution Football League (HiFL) on Saturday beating University of Calabar (Malabites) 5-4 on penalties after the final played at the Agege Stadium ended goalless. UAM Tillers started the game on the front foot, with their skipper Ebuka David at the thick of the action but the Okorie Okechukwu-led defence stood resilient. The Malabites hit back with attacking midfielder Abate Terkuma running the show but both sides lacked the cutting edge and failed to match the spectatorsâ€™ vibes. The first 45 minutes ended goalless; but the second half did not produce any goal despite efforts by both teams. Earlier, OAU Giants defeated UNILORIN Warriors 3-1 to place third in the collegiate competition.
