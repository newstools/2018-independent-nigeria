Calabar – The All Progressive Congress (APC) in Cross River State has it will do everything possible to resist plans by ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state to appoint caretaker committees to oversee local government councils in the state. In an interaction with newsmen in Calabar, the State Chairman of APC, Dr. Mathew Achigbe noted that local government elections had been due for the 18 local government councils in the states since 2016 but the state governor, Prof. Ben Ayade flouted the constitutional provisions and refused to allow the State Independent Electoral Commission conducts the elections. Senior civil servants at various local government levels had been the ones running the affairs of the various local councils in the state. Achigbe noted that they got a tip-off on the plans of Governor Ayade to appoint caretaker committees into the local government councils in the state. “We will resist it because it is unconstitutional. Elections should be conducted. APC had since been prepared for local government elections in the state but the PDP government of Governor Ben Ayade has kept frustrating the elections. Now, he thinks he can hurriedly do the unconstitutional by appointing persons they could use to influence the 2019 elections in their favour across the local government areas. We will resist such unconstitutionality.” Reacting to the APC chairman, his PDP counterpart in the state, Ntufam Inok Edim said, “Why is APC concern about what strategy the PDP uses for the elections? The governor will not do what is not right. If he deems it right that such appointments are made, he will do it. Besides, those appointed will be Cross River people and they have families and dependents who will be affected positively.”
