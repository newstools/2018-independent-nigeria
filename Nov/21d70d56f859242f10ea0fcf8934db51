Lagos – The referee of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier between South Africa and Nigeria on Saturday in Johannesburg, Bakary Papa Gassama, has blamed absence of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) for disallowing two good scored scored by the Super Eagles in the game. The referee also apologised to the Super Eagles due to the wrong offside calls. Nigeria would have won the match if VAR was used in the game. Ahmed Musa had put through Kelechi Iheanacho who tapped home believing he has given Nigeria the lead but Musa who supplied the pass was judged by the assistant referee as been in an offside position, something which turned out to be wrong after video replays. In the second half, with less than five minutes to go, Musa was once again at the receiving end of another poor referee decision as he was once again flagged offside incorrectly after slotting home what could have given Nigeria all the three points. The game ended 1-1 with Nigeria sealing her passage to next year Africa Cup of Nations but officials of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) still expressed their unhappiness to Gassama over the poor decision which cost Nigeria a win. Gassama admitted the error and even went a step further by sending his apologies to Musa over the incident although he admitted that such errors were sometimes unavoidable particularly due to the non-availability of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR). But Chief Adegboye onigbinde, former FIFA and CAF Technical Committee member, has believes his apology “is immaterial.” “Will his apology reverse his decision of change the outcome of the game,” he asked rhetorically. “As far as am concerned his apology is immaterial,” he said. According to him, Nigerias or any other country does not need to beg for the introduction of VAR. “If the authoriuty feels it is necessary, they will introduce it,” advising that we should  wait for the Confederation of African Football on what they will do.
