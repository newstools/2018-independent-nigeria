Lagos – The Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) players have expressed frustration over the indefinite postponement in the resumption date of the 2018/2019 season. The players, who spoke to DAILY INDEPENDENT in separate interviews, expressed dismay that the NPFL, which abruptly ended last season after a lengthy delay in resumption after the 2018 World Cup, should have resumed as planned, not minding the hiccups. Speaking to our correspondent, Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM)’s Chuka Uwaga, said that the development was not a good one, questioning the rationale in the shift, which he noted had psychologically affected the players adversely. “This is not a good thing to hear because we are already preparing hard for the December 1 kickoff. Players are not happy. On a personal note, I am not happy with this,” he said. Speaking similarly, Yinka Onaolapo, who plays for Enyimba of Aba, said that some of the players were tired of what was happening in the domestic scene and wished to move abroad. “We are tired of the league and everybody wants to leave for something better abroad. How can the league be postponed indefinitely at this time? We are not getting it very right and it is shattering news,” he said. Akwa United’s Ifeanyi Ifeany said that no player worth his salt would like the development, noting that the players were in solidarity to condemn the training without playing. “We don’t feel happy at all. We have already prepared but it is very unfortunate. I know every player desirous of a good career will condemn this postponement because we are tired of always training without playing,” he lamented. Dele Ajiboye, the Plateau United goalie, meanwhile, called on the authorities to quickly sort out the problem and resume the league.
