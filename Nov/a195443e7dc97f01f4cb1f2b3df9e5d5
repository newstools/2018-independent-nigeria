Lagos – Super Eagles technical adviser, Gerbnot Rohr has said that they owe the government of Delta State a good result from Saturday’s match in South Africa, in order to show how much they appreciated the good conditions they enjoyed at their camp in Asaba. While also pointing out that the team must win Tuesday’s international friendly against the Cranes of Uganda in Asaba, Rohr is excited with the welfare and facilities the Super Eagles enjoyed during their four-day stay. Rohr is already looking forward to the Super Eagles return to Asaba on Sunday, ahead of which he stated delight with what he called improvements on the pitch of Stephen Keshi Stadium, which will host the friendly against Uganda. In contrast with his previous lukewarm verdict about the stadium pitch last week, Rohr spoke with more enthusiasm this time out in his speech during the visit by Delta State governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa. He said his response to promises by Okowa to treat the Super Eagles better when they return from South Africa, that he is looking forward to his side playing on the turf of the Asaba stadium on Tuesday. “I thank the Delta State Government for their hospitality and for making us feel so comfortable. I am so happy because the pitch is in a much better state than the last time I was here. “The Super Eagles will continue to work hard to make all those who have played one role or the other in its progress happy that their investment in the team is not a waste. “Our mission in Johannesburg is simple: qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations. We are not thinking of anything else. We want the ticket in our pocket before the final qualifier against Seychelles”, he said.
