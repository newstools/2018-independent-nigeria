YENAGOA – There is public outrage in Bayelsa State following the brutal killing of a male youth named Tarila Nikade, 20-year-old 300-level student of the Niger Delta University by a trigger-happy police officer in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. Nikade was reportedly shot dead in controversial circumstances at about 7.30pm on Friday along the Tinacious Road in Edepie area of the state capital, where he resided. It was gathered that the undergraduate was rushed to a hospital where he was confirmed dead after the attack. On Saturday morning, scores of concerned youths, mostly students, took over the Edepie-Igbogene axis of the Mbiama-Yenagoa Road to protest the killing of Nikade by the police officer. Their action caused gridlock and disrupted the monthly sanitation exercise directed by the Bayelsa State Environmental Sanitation Authority as they demanded justice, saying it was one police killing too many in the state. Nikade’s killing happened barely 14 days after an armed gang attacked and killed Seiyefa Fred, a 16-year-old female undergraduate of the same Niger Delta University, on November 9 in Amarata area of Yenagoa as the challenge of insecurity heightened in Bayelsa. The state police command on Saturday confirmed Nikade’s killing and gave the name of the policeman involved as Sergeant Timadi Emmanuel. Asinim Butswat, a Deputy Duperintendent of Police (DSP), the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRC), said through a statement, that  Sergeant Emmanuel was attached to a patrol team of Akenfa Division. It stated that the police officer killed the victim “under questionable circumstances” while on patrol at the Tinacious Road, describing it as an “unfortunate incident”. The command condoled with the family of the slain student, assuring that justice would be done.
