Lagos – After a successful outing at this year’s Federation Cup competition where they emerged champions, players and officials of Rangers International of Enugu will begin training on Monday (today) in preparations for the CAF Confederation Cup. DAILY INDEPENDENT gathered that the ‘Flying Antelopes’ would trade tackles with Defence FC of Ethiopia in a preliminary match for the CAF Confederation Cup billed for Enugu on Tuesday, November 27. Meanwhile, Rangers Chief Coach, Gbenga Ogunbote has said that the team cannot afford to take their opponents for granted even as he said his players would be going out for an outright victory. Ogunbote declared that his die will be gunning for a bright start to their continental campaign as he hopes his team can record a big win in the qualifying encounter then go on to shine in the 2019 CAF Confederation Cup. Though he admitted that his team’s opponents are little known and from a small football playing nation, he however promised that his players would not underrate their foes, but said they will use them as a stepping stone to greater exploits on the continent. “We have got a fair draw. We need to make a statement on the continent “We don’t have to underrate the opponents, but we must be sure of winning convincingly here in Enugu to make the return leg a mere formality”, said Ogunbote. It will be recalled that Rangers defeated Kano Pillars 4-2 (penalty kicks) in the final of this year’s Federation Cup competition at the Stephen Keshi Memorial Stadium, Asaba, Delta State, to lift the trophy after a very long time.
