ABUJA – Leon Aliboh, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Environment, on Tuesday decried lack of access to sanitary facilities among Nigerians, saying that about 4.5 billion people live without safe toilet across the globe. Aliboh, who stated this at a press briefing to flag-off activities in commemoration of the 2018 World Toilet Day in Abuja, disclosed that his ministry in collaboration with relevant agencies has put together activities to mark the annual event, which holds every November 19. According to him, there will be community awareness campaigns, school sensitization, sanitary inspection of Federal Government facilities, motor parks and markets, among other places. “Access to sanitary facilities remains a mirage to a vast majority of our citizenry. Today, 4.5 billion people in the world live without safe toilet and 892 million people still practise open defecation, as many people still use the bush and water bodies as their regular means for excreta disposal. Many institutions do not have sanitary facilities and where they exist; they are either not functioning well or misused. “One of the major consequences of poor excreta disposal is high rate of diarrhea disease, which is the second cause of high rate of morbidity and mortality amongst children under the age of five. The persistent recurrence of annual incidence of cholera outbreaks in some of states and the recurrence of other excreta related diseases are also manifestations of inadequate toilet facilities,” he said.
