The management and staff of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) have donated relief materials worth over N300 millions to communities affected by devastating floods in the Niger Delta states of Rivers, Bayelsa, and Delta. General Manager External Relations, Mr. Igo Weli, said the staff made personal donations to complement the company’s US$1 million donation, because we care and want to help affected people overcome the effect of the flood disaster.” SPDC will also donate USD125, 000 to the National Red Cross Society to support the provision of relief materials to nominated Local Government Areas and communities affected in Kogi State as well as provide relief materials to affected families in Anambra State. Weli said the relief materials are to support the people to have some normalcy until the flood completely recedes. Delta State Commissioner, Bureau for Special Duties and Chairman Delta State Relief Committee, Dr. Ernest Ogwezzy, described SPDC as “a good neighbour”. The Commissioner, who spoke at the Patani IDP Camp, thanked SPDC “for identifying with the people at a time of need.”
