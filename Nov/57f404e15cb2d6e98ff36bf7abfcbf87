Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, had claimed that he donated N10 million to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and other agencies organising the National anti-corruption marathon. But the EFCC has denied this in a tweet on Tuesday. #Alert For the avoidance of doubt, no State governor or some other individual or group has donated any amount of money to the EFCC to carry out the Anti-corruption Marathon project or any other project for that matter. — EFCC Nigeria (@officialEFCC) November 27, 2018  The EFCC said: “#Alert For the avoidance of doubt, no State governor or some other individual or group has donated any amount of money to the EFCC to carry out the Anti-corruption Marathon project or any other project for that matter.” This Ganduje was reported to have announced his donatio  when he received members of the main organising committee in Abuja. The EFCC collaborated with the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and Athletic Federation of Nigeria (AFN) to organise the programme in honour of President Muhammadu Buhari. “Before now, people find it difficult to access the services of the agency but we established offices across the 44 local government areas so that the services can be available to the common man. “We also facilitated the recruitment of additional personnel and subjected them to training by professional agencies like EFCC and ICPC so that they can deliver. “We also ensured cooperation with these agencies and that attracted international organizations to support us in reinforcing our anti-corruption system,” Ganduje was quoted as saying. It will be recalled that Ganduje was recently alleged of collecting bribes from contrators in some video clips that went viral.
