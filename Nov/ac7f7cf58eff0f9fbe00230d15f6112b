Lagos – Thomas Dennerby, Super Falcons Head Coach, says beating She-Polopolo of Zambia 4-0 on Wednesday in their second group game of the ongoing 2018 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations was not the group’s defining game, hinting that the team still need to work harder in their third group game against Equatorial Guinea on Saturday. The coach is also not happy with Falcons performance despite the win. Falcons redeem their image on Wednesday with the 4-0 win having lost their opening group game 1-0 to South Africa and it is only a win on Saturday against Equatorial Guinea that can guarantee Falcons a semi-final ticket. As a result, Coach Dennerby believes that the win was not defining game in the group on the premise that their last group game against Equatorial Guinea was a must win. “I don’t think this game we won today (Wednesday) is the defining game in the group,” he said on Wednesday after beating Zambia 4-0, adding, “and now we have to work harder in our next fixture so we secure a place in the semi-finals. “So we stay cool and keep working. Of course I am happier than three days ago. “First of all, I am very happy we managed to score four goals in this game but honestly I am not 100 per cent happy with our performance because we should have scored more goals. “After our opening game in which we lost, I talked about being professional and using experience to come back in the next game, not being anxious and work on hard. Bruce Mwape, Zambia head Coach, blame their loss on lack of consistency in the game. “My team made a lot of mistakes especially during transition, thus we lost most of the balls. “After winning 5-0 in our first game against Equatorial Guinea, a lot of people were expecting us to give Nigeria tough time, unfortunately things didn’t go as planned. “Lack of consistency cost us. If we had played the way we did in our first game, the story could have been different.”
