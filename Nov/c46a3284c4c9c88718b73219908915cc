Chief Adesunbo Onitiri, the Lagos Central Senatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ,  expressed reservation about the on-going distribution of Tradermoni by the Federal Government to traders in parts of Lagos and its environs. In a statement in Lagos yesterday and signed, Onitiri, an Estate Surveyor and Valauer explained that though, tradermoni being dished out to traders is good gesture with bad execution and motive. “If the policy drivers intend it to solve poverty, it is wrongly directed. What the government should do is to wipe out poverty within the rank and file of the entire populace, not dolling out few Naira to traders and think that will take away poverty in their families. According to him,   instead of throwing money around, the government should create enabling environment for business to thrive. “They can also pay all unemployed citizens stipends monthly create farm settlements for youths and train them in agriculture. Teach them how to fish, not to give them fish and think you have solved their poverty problems.” He  pointed out that he felt a rat with the dishing out of the tradermoni by the Vice President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo in Lagos when the election is few months away. “The timing of the tradermoni is circumspect. Why now that the elections are around the corner. Nigerians can no longer be fooled. Our mumu don do!. Onitiri advised the traders to collect the money after all, it is our collective money. The traders should vote wisely and according to their own conscience. “ The tradermoni is a ploy to buy votes and should be seen as such by all patriotic Nigerians, he added.
