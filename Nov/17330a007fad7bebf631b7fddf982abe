OWERRI – Rochas Okorocha, Imo State governor, has advised the 2065, 2018 batch C Stream 1 corps members deployed in the state to be cautious in the use of the social media as it has both positive and adverse effects. Governor Okorocha who gave the charge while performing the official closing of the orientation course of the corps members at the NYSC Orientation Camp in Eziama Obaire, Nkwerre LGA, urged them to use the social media to create jobs for themselves in view of non- existing white-collar jobs in the country. Represented by Ifeanyichukwu Onwueyiagba, the Commissioner for Talents and Youth Development, the governor advised them to shun illegal and unauthorised travels and to obtain clearance from the appropriate quarters where it becomes inevitable for them to travel. “You should demonstrate love to one another, avoid hate speeches, religious bigotry and “pull him down syndrome.” Our nation is gradually going through transformation and you should assist the government to drive home its laudable objectives,” he said. While commending the corps members for their outstanding performance during the orientation course, the governor assured that he would take steps to provide more infrastructural facilities at the orientation camp to enhance their comfort. Sunday Robert Aroni, the state coordinator of the NYSC, in an address earlier implored them to put into practice all that they learnt in the camp, reminding them of their lessons on security, drug abuse/control, Servicom, voter education and disaster management on getting to their areas of primary assignment.
