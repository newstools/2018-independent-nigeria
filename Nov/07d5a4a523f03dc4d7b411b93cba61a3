SEGUN OLANIYAN KATSINA – Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State on Wednesday launched 25 new buses worth over N1.1 billion to boost the fleet of the state Transport Authority (KTSTA). Masari, while speaking at occasion, lamented that out of the over 90 vehicles in the agency’s fleet, only two were serviceable and could convey passengers to Abuja from Katsina. He directed the new management of the authority to save one third of its monthly proceeds from the new vehicles to purchase a new bus, another one third to pay salaries and another one third to conduct normal services on the vehicles. Masari also directed the new management to stop the purchase and running of tricycles and car hire business activities, as such was beyond the scope of the agency. The governor, who revealed plans by the administration to purchase tricycles for operators of the machines as soft loan, said government had no right to run tricycle business. He however warned that erring drivers must not only be removed, but punished for either vandalisation or diversion of transport fares for personal gains. He also warned against allowing affluent people to be enjoying the subsidy being offered by the vehicles to the detriment of the common man. Alhaji Haruna Musa Rugoji, General Manager of the agency, recalled that Masari made history as the Commissioner of Works in 1992, who recommended the reactivation of the KTSTA after it was disbanded by late Colonel John Madaki’s military administration in the state. Rugoji said after the agency had gone into comatose, Masari, as the state governor, had turned around the fortunes of agency with the purchase of the 25 new buses.
