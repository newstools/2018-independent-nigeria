Lagos – La Liga Nacional de Futbol Profesional, also known as La Liga Business School, on Tuesday, October 30, signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Lagos Business School (LBS) in Lekki, Lagos. The MoU is based on an agreement between both parties to promote capacity development and most importantly initiate and implement purpose-specific programmes that foster successful sports business management and administration in Nigeria. Speaking at a press conference organised to announce the MOU, LBS Dean, Enase Okonedo, said, “The collaboration with La Liga is to help LBS achieve its mission of advancing management disciplines. We are collaborating to create robust programmes that offer participants the global expertise and local relevance that is only obtainable at LBS”. Okonedo added that although sports has been professionalised in many parts of the world, sports management remained an area in which Nigeria lacks structured trainings hence the timeliness of the partnership. In line with the terms of the MOU, the Sports Business Management Programme, a two-day intensive training for sports media practitioners, owners and managers of sports business outfits and other stakeholders in the sports industry, commenced today. Managing Director La Liga Nigeria, Javier Del Rio, said: “This is a strategic alliance which reaffirms our commitment to the development of not only football but education in this country. We are highly committed to each of our projects across Africa and partnering with LBS to offer sport management courses is definitely a good step forward and in the right direction towards the growth and development of sports management in Nigeria.”
